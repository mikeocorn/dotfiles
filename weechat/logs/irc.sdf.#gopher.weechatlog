2018-09-21 11:00:03	tomasino	No more gophernicus? What are they using now
2018-09-21 11:00:48	%ulcer	ETHANOL
2018-09-21 11:05:48	tomasino	I suspect it's motsognir
2018-09-21 11:06:03	tomasino	It's stricter than gophernicus
2018-09-21 11:06:49	tomasino	My hole seems fine on SDF.org still, but burrow is configured to play nice with the stricter requirements
2018-09-21 11:07:47	tomasino	The biggest difference is that motsognir doesn't automatically add "i" types to gophermap lines without links
2018-09-21 11:10:56	@benharri	oh that's annoying :P
2018-09-21 11:10:58	@benharri	i use that a lot
2018-09-21 11:11:11	@benharri	well whenever i actually do manually write gophermaps
2018-09-21 11:11:28	tomasino	yeah, i had to write a special thing in burrow to do that for me
2018-09-21 11:11:41	tomasino	otherwise writing gophermaps long like i do gets annoying as hell
2018-09-21 11:14:21	@benharri	^^
2018-09-21 11:14:34	@benharri	one of the reasons i like just writing it as txt
2018-09-21 11:17:06	tomasino	hrm, no... it's generating the type i for me as long as there's no end-tab
2018-09-21 11:17:10	tomasino	maybe not motsognir
2018-09-21 11:17:18	tomasino	pygopherd then, maybe?
2018-09-21 11:19:26	@benharri	there's no footer with the gopherd sig
2018-09-21 11:19:29	@benharri	heh
2018-09-21 11:20:51	tomasino	nope! which i normally prefer

2018-09-21 11:21:36	@benharri	srsly
2018-09-21 11:30:10	tomasino	sdf.eu was updated as well
2018-09-21 11:30:30	@benharri	hmmst
2018-09-21 11:30:35	tomasino	still looks like http://motsognir.sourceforge.net/ to me
2018-09-21 11:30:50	tomasino	but i can't be sure. i don't see a process running anywhere and netstat doesn't show anything listening on port 70
2018-09-21 11:30:54	tomasino	but maybe i'm on the wrong box
2018-09-21 11:31:02	tomasino	sdf is a puzzle when it comes to server hardware
2018-09-21 11:32:10	@benharri	sure is

2018-09-30 01:45:23	%ulcer	very nice btw. it almost deserves to be on hacker news :p
2018-09-30 01:46:34	%ulcer	also please don't do xml with awk and more important don't recommend people to do so :D ot
2018-09-30 01:47:02	zcrayfish	^ I 2nd the recommendation to keep XML and AWK separated by at least a few AUs
2018-09-30 01:47:03	%ulcer	it's like offering them to write sed programs in assembler - it's just time wasting
2018-09-30 01:48:32	%ulcer	there are xmlstarlet and these tools https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/README not mentioning standard approach
2018-09-30 01:48:59	%ulcer	(though i understand your initial constraints)
2018-09-30 01:51:47	%ulcer	also as you work with quoted CSV/TSV it's also task where awk is NOT effient, where you should stick to miller(1) or full-featured tools (perl or whatever)

2018-09-30 05:40:54	dbucklin	ulcer: thanks for your comments. I did hesitate on the XML bullet point, but decided to leave it in.
2018-09-30 05:41:24	dbucklin	Using Git for Windows is very constraining. I can't install things that are not included.
2018-09-30 05:41:39	dbucklin	xmlstarlet, for example.
2018-09-30 05:43:09	dbucklin	I referred to bash in Git for Windows as an emulation because I believe, perhaps incorrectly, that it's not really bash, or at least not a full implementation of it.
2018-09-30 05:43:58	dbucklin	There are a number of differences between bash in Git for Windows and bash on Debian.
2018-09-30 05:44:56	dbucklin	bacterio: thanks for your help.
2018-09-30 05:45:14	zcrayfish	Debian didn't go full dash already? ;)
2018-09-30 05:45:16	dbucklin	On another topic, I see that the Haiku web browser supports Gopher.
2018-09-30 05:45:31	zcrayfish	Nice.
2018-09-30 05:46:32	dbucklin	zcrayfish: I picked up a book on the Korn shell expecting it to be substantially difference from bash, but there is a lot of overlap.
2018-09-30 05:46:49	dbucklin	Is that also true of dash?
2018-09-30 05:47:35	dbucklin	I supposed there has to be if you want your shell to comply with POSIX.
2018-09-30 05:48:30	zcrayfish	dash is more basic. 
2018-09-30 05:48:38	zcrayfish	It's not too far off though
2018-09-30 05:55:17	@bacterio	dbluckin: the less i can do. i wish i have more experience.

2018-10-02 06:40:29	+ulcer	with history of russian induced provocations over past 100 years it can be only conscious publication
2018-10-02 07:05:03	+ulcer	it should be mentioned that following questionable accents of this article, there's another anonymous response on medium, which reaccent to more detailed and accurate info to please reader, because other article on account contains another more recent .ru propaganda message

2018-10-02 19:44:37	+ulcer	so i was right about conclusions on article. author switched to bellingcat from voanews with miroslava gongadze which is caught multiple times on spreading fakes
2018-10-02 19:46:14	zcrayfish	voanews? == Voice Of America?
2018-10-02 19:46:21	+ulcer	yes
2018-10-02 19:46:50	zcrayfish	There's a reason they are not allowed to broadcast in/to the US itself: it's pure propaganda.
2018-10-02 19:48:36	+ulcer	there's nothing wrong with propaganda itself when russians broadcast directly and indirectly from every clothes iron
2018-10-02 19:49:47	⚡	zcrayfish shrugs
2018-10-02 19:51:45	+ulcer	all you have to know about modern journalism is that not a single mediawhore made apologize in case of forged .ru refugee journalist assassination and called for "professional solidarity" instead
2018-10-02 19:56:36	+ulcer	this lead to social media problem; if tv is simply straightforward brainwasher, newsmedia with such "solidarity" is just upgrade. in this condition word-of-mouth news, opinion leader and all modern crap of social medias with verified accounts which care for their reputation is very viable alternative

2018-10-03 14:02:14	tomasino	the more i think about it the more excited i am for a little free (digital) library. I think I'll keep exploring it and figure out how to get the power draw as low as possible and make the thing as self-contained as possible. 
2018-10-03 14:09:39	tomasino	oh, and cheap!
2018-10-03 14:10:28	tomasino	a pi zero, 3d printed case glued to a solar battery, maybe wrap the whole thing in a plastic shell as long as it doesn't affect the solar
2018-10-03 14:11:27	tomasino	I may need a second wifi adapter to serve up the network to connect to. Not sure the pi zero w internal can do it, or if I'd end up locking myself out of it somehow.
2018-10-03 14:11:44	tomasino	i figure the hard part is a reliable solar set up that's cheap
2018-10-03 14:12:42	tomasino	then I can do a really light weight static site over http, force it to open on wifi connection, serve up epubs & mobis with some thumbnails. I can probably generate the web stuff out of calibre if I play with it.

2018-10-03 14:27:19	tomasino	on sdf i think i use gsed instead of sed. that's the difference there
2018-10-03 14:27:39	@benharri	so you're not checking if the incoming commit is newer?
2018-10-03 14:27:41	@benharri	just different?

2018-10-03 14:28:20	tomasino	i don't directly manipulate gopher on my mirrors, so there's no situation where it would be different and not newer
2018-10-03 14:28:30	tomasino	oh, sdf i use the path /users/tomasino instead of ~tomasino as well
2018-10-03 14:28:31	@benharri	ah ok that's fair

2018-10-04 20:55:16	zcrayfish	So when I had chrome's developer crap in Nexus 4 mode, I figured that the reason the text was going off the right side of the screen was because the div had a width set...
2018-10-04 20:55:26	zcrayfish	logically I unset the width in the on-the-fly editor
2018-10-04 20:55:30	zcrayfish	did it fix the problem? fuck no.
2018-10-04 20:55:58	zcrayfish	it didn't rerender the page. weird.
2018-10-04 20:56:08	zcrayfish	but anyway the fix was as simple as changing width to max-width

2018-10-05 21:23:31	tomasino	my personal nextcloud is all happily set up with collabora and stuff. it runs my calendar and contact db. stuff like that

2018-10-05 21:36:03	tomasino	dokuja: i'd use my main nextcloud for this stuff as well, but it eats up space. I pay for external hosting for that account and the space will cost more. I'm cheap. SDF was a nice free solution with the 100GB storage. Syncthing will do instead
2018-10-05 21:59:43	@dokuja	Syncthing doesn't store your data in a centralized location?
2018-10-05 22:00:38	@dokuja	If that's true, then what's the difference between using it and having a nextcloud instance at home?

2018-10-06 10:43:34	zcrayfish	ulcer: ``used images of celebrities such as the actress Emma Watson to amass young followers on social networks.'' <-- if they are dumb enough to fall for that............
2018-10-06 10:49:23	%ulcer	zcrayfish: people fall for it. i've noticed plenty of groups popularizing techy DIY stuff promoting russians and drawing their picture as good chaps. other example of similar nature is traveling groups, which fill 40% of posts with russia's sights, sealing good picture of russia in memory of observer
2018-10-06 10:50:16	%ulcer	that was article in thetimes.co.ua with promised expansion
2018-10-06 10:50:48	%ulcer	this one had different goals
2018-10-06 10:51:28	zcrayfish	I know they fall for it... I report fake accounts on FB all the time. :(
2018-10-06 10:51:47	zcrayfish	So far FB has deleted 5-10% of them, tops
2018-10-06 10:52:22	zcrayfish	And out of those 5-10% that they did delete, it's because not only was the account fake, but I reported them multiple times for breaking other rules (such as publicly posting pornography)
2018-10-06 10:52:23	%ulcer	tech giants reported splash in factory acc registration some months ago
2018-10-06 10:53:19	%ulcer	but fb already enforced additional measures for alt accounts
2018-10-06 10:59:19	%ulcer	also if you question "how it can be that dumb" check news on GRU captured in Netherlands
2018-10-06 11:00:16	zcrayfish	it == Russia?

2018-10-06 11:00:41	zcrayfish	ok
2018-10-06 11:01:06	%ulcer	fake celebrities accounts forging
2018-10-06 11:01:33	zcrayfish	The forgers are not dumb; they're clearly smarter than the victims 
2018-10-06 11:04:26	%ulcer	forging leaders video could be much more worse. so far we don't face it.
2018-10-06 11:04:56	zcrayfish	I have to agree with you there
2018-10-06 11:05:48	zcrayfish	There are some popular news sources (The Daily Mail immediately comes to mind) that basically do zero fact checking that if they got their hands on a fake video, could spread it far and wide quickly... and people would absolutely believe it.

2018-10-09 18:36:11	+cat	floodgap makes my gophermaps look a bit squished which bothers me and the one on muffinlabs is a bit too overkill so this is just what i need
2018-10-09 18:36:18	@benharri	pb should get support for url shortening :)

2018-10-13 22:49:21	zcrayfish	It does not have gopher natively, but it happily tells you to use a proxy server, which, for a web browser, I think, is THE RIGHT THING
2018-10-13 22:49:40	zcrayfish	works fine with Squid

2018-10-14 20:10:51	zcrayfish	except for watch out for potential rendering issues (STILL) thanks to lynx being broken. (& not turned into entity &amp; before parsing. it's a miracle it works)

2018-10-14 20:14:16	@dokuja	I was working on a similar project with a (now) old RasPi B.  Hooked up a part 15 xmitter to it and was going to allow it to play whatever's found in the upload directory
2018-10-14 20:15:27	@dokuja	I stopped when I realized everyone's jacked into their iDevices that nobody even realizes radio still exists.

2018-10-14 20:16:55	+mn4v	HTML is called a markup language. what is the gophermap "language" called?
2018-10-14 20:17:12	zcrayfish	just gophermap as far as I know
2018-10-14 20:17:21	@dokuja	yeah, I guess gophermap
2018-10-14 20:17:27	@tomasino	text

2018-10-14 20:18:05	+mn4v	and is there a way to keep irc open while i'm setting up my server?
2018-10-14 20:18:16	@tomasino	tmux?
2018-10-14 20:18:32	+mn4v	I'm in ssh
2018-10-14 20:18:34	zcrayfish	It's a TSV file. (except for curiously, no tab between the item type + display string)
2018-10-14 20:18:35	@dokuja	probably a second terminal
2018-10-14 20:18:52	@dokuja	unless you have access to a screen multiplexer
2018-10-14 20:19:01	@dokuja	(screen/tmux)
2018-10-14 20:19:07	+mn4v	hmm
2018-10-14 20:19:35	@dokuja	what are you connecting on?
2018-10-14 20:19:36	+mn4v	isn't there connect host and port so I can use weechat in other terminal?
2018-10-14 20:19:54	+mn4v	like irc.sdf.org
2018-10-14 20:20:15	zcrayfish	yes.
2018-10-14 20:20:15	@dokuja	irc.sdf.org is this IRC server
2018-10-14 20:20:16	+mn4v	I'm using the freeirc command in ssh
2018-10-14 20:20:25	+mn4v	lol
2018-10-14 20:20:27	+mn4v	okay
2018-10-14 20:20:29	zcrayfish	=)
2018-10-14 20:20:30	+mn4v	thanks
2018-10-14 20:20:32	@tomasino	oh, yes, if you want to connect externally, irc.sdf.org works
2018-10-14 20:20:45	zcrayfish	It mentions SSL or TLS somewhere, ignore it, there ain't any. xD
2018-10-14 20:20:48	zcrayfish	just plain IRC
2018-10-14 20:21:03	+cat	if you're using a terminal on a gui like Terminal in OSX or PUTTY or whatever you should be able to open a second window and log in twice if you need to
2018-10-14 20:21:28	+mn4v	I'm in xfce terminal
2018-10-14 20:21:46	@dokuja	yeah, you could just open a second terminal window
2018-10-14 20:22:00	+mn4v	but forget what I just said
2018-10-14 20:22:01	+cat	that should work! if you don't have screen/tmux access or whatever on SDF :3
2018-10-14 20:22:20	+cat	
2018-10-14 20:22:29	+cat	ooos
2018-10-14 20:22:29	+mn4v	I was trying to do it without opening another tab
2018-10-14 20:22:53	+mn4v	seems impossible
2018-10-14 20:24:20	@dokuja	if you have screen/tmux on your computer you can use that to mux two sessions for the same window

2018-10-14 20:25:18	mN4v7lG	okay I'm here
2018-10-14 20:25:23	@dokuja	hello again
2018-10-14 20:25:31		mn4v has quit (Quit: Xaric: If you have a better quit message then submit a patch!)
2018-10-14 20:25:59	mN4v7lG	hello
2018-10-14 20:26:42	mN4v7lG	by the way, this gophermap file should be called just "gophermap"?
2018-10-14 20:27:10	@dokuja	yes, if you want it to replace the directory listing
2018-10-14 20:27:43	mN4v7lG	and if I want another file then I use "something.gophermap"?
2018-10-14 20:29:48	@tomasino	if you want to link to another gophermap you can do that from your first one by using any name, as long as you call it as type 1. However, most often you want to link to a text file. That's type 0, and you just point to the filename
2018-10-14 20:30:09	@tomasino	most people keep gophermaps named "gophermap" in directories of better names
2018-10-14 20:30:23	@tomasino	all my phlog posts are like that, for instance
2018-10-14 20:30:36	@tomasino	but it's easiest to just point to text unless you want a listing of more links
2018-10-14 20:30:58	@dokuja	so, yes you could conceivable use another name.  I never do that, but I just checked.
2018-10-14 20:31:21	mN4v7lG	well, I'm starting to understand
2018-10-14 20:32:07	mN4v7lG	I just think gopher could be more "well documented"
2018-10-14 20:32:20	@dokuja	gopher://circumlunar.space/1/~dokuja/test.gophermap
2018-10-14 20:33:35	@dokuja	although it looks like relative links break.  they'll have to be absolute.
2018-10-14 20:33:54	@dokuja	at least for gophernicus
2018-10-14 20:35:08	zcrayfish	as in links with .. in it?
2018-10-14 20:36:37	@dokuja	links that don't have the full path, hostname, port
2018-10-14 20:36:55	zcrayfish	oh,
2018-10-14 20:37:03	zcrayfish	I just use the full shebang every time :x
2018-10-14 20:37:05	@dokuja	maybe if I just supply hostname and port relative might work.
2018-10-14 20:37:37	@dokuja	but, meh.  not that interested.
2018-10-14 20:38:05	mN4v7lG	well, this doesn't look so easy to me
2018-10-14 20:38:32	mN4v7lG	but I'm trying. practice leads to perfection
2018-10-14 20:39:56	@tomasino	most of thath stuff is server specific trickery
2018-10-14 20:40:04	@tomasino	the relative linking and whatnot
2018-10-14 20:42:24	@dokuja	yeah.
2018-10-14 20:47:56	mN4v7lG	just a question
2018-10-14 20:48:22	zcrayfish	fire away
2018-10-14 20:48:30	mN4v7lG	why is the "i" appearing in front of my texts?
2018-10-14 20:49:07	zcrayfish	what's the URL you are using?
2018-10-14 20:49:23	mN4v7lG	and why the access to the file is denied?
2018-10-14 20:49:38	mN4v7lG	gopher://sdf.org/1/users/mn4v
2018-10-14 20:53:20	⚡	zcrayfish investigates
2018-10-14 20:54:57	@dokuja	I see your gophermap
2018-10-14 20:55:02	+cat	i don't see the i on your info lines but the test file is missing the 0 itemtype as the first character on that line and the permissions are probably just because SDf is strict
2018-10-14 20:55:10	+cat	chmod 644 test.txt
2018-10-14 20:55:53	mN4v7lG	yeah I changed the gophermap and removed the "i"s
2018-10-14 20:56:16	mN4v7lG	but this appear to be wrong since the documentation said it is needed
2018-10-14 20:57:04	mN4v7lG	the chmod worked
2018-10-14 20:57:11	mN4v7lG	thanks
2018-10-14 20:57:14	zcrayfish	cool
2018-10-14 20:57:33	zcrayfish	gophernicus treats lines it does not know how to deal with as type i anyway
2018-10-14 20:57:50	mN4v7lG	but I'm a little bit confused with the "i"
2018-10-14 20:58:07	mN4v7lG	hmm
2018-10-14 20:58:39	mN4v7lG	but what happens if my ascii starts with 0?
2018-10-14 20:59:40	zcrayfish	you mean the first byte in the text file will be a 0?
2018-10-14 20:59:40	+cat	i0[tab]/[tab]null.host[tab]70
2018-10-14 20:59:57	+cat	you had no tab between path and host and i think that broke it
2018-10-14 20:59:58	zcrayfish	as long as you have it linked as type 0, the client knows to treat it as just plain text and not a gopher menu
2018-10-14 21:00:33	+cat	the gophermap translator assuming the subsequent tab was the path and falling over
2018-10-14 21:00:39	zcrayfish	that would do it; it confused gophernicus so it treated the type as part of the display string.
2018-10-14 21:01:41	mN4v7lG	is there a way to remove the gophernicus footer?
2018-10-14 21:02:14	+cat	that's set at aserver level so nah
2018-10-14 21:02:24	+cat	unless you want to ask the sdf to do so
2018-10-14 21:02:38	mN4v7lG	nah
2018-10-14 21:02:51	mN4v7lG	that's not too important tough
2018-10-14 21:04:18	zcrayfish	if you name your gophermap file something other than gophermap (as in this lame example: gopher://sdf.org/1/users/zcray/notagophermap )
2018-10-14 21:04:27	zcrayfish	aside from that, no 
2018-10-14 21:05:24	mN4v7lG	but it will not act like an index I think
2018-10-14 21:05:57	zcrayfish	It will be entirely static; gophernicus wouldn't modify anything... so it would have to be perfect
2018-10-14 21:06:10	zcrayfish	so not my first choice
2018-10-14 21:07:17	mN4v7lG	it's kinda buggy now
2018-10-14 21:09:11	mN4v7lG	other thing I dislike is this huge left margin
2018-10-14 21:09:51	zcrayfish	in lynx?
2018-10-14 21:10:12	mN4v7lG	yeah
2018-10-14 21:10:39	mN4v7lG	and the worst thing isn't the margin itself
2018-10-14 21:11:01	zcrayfish	yes, that's where the filetype is displayed.
2018-10-14 21:11:01	mN4v7lG	it's that the footer starts after the margin
2018-10-14 21:11:17	mN4v7lG	this is ugly
2018-10-14 21:12:01	@tomasino	vf1 is much prettier
2018-10-14 21:12:14	mN4v7lG	I'm starting to understand why gopher is deprecated
2018-10-14 21:12:29	@tomasino	once you get gophermaps down, there's nothing more. 
2018-10-14 21:12:34	@tomasino	that's the whole thing
2018-10-14 21:12:53	@tomasino	sdf makes stuff a little harder with their strict umask defaults
2018-10-14 21:12:55	zcrayfish	Well, keep in mind that a good deal of the gopher clients are just ripped from libwww
2018-10-14 21:13:03	zcrayfish	which is literally what lynx does
2018-10-14 21:13:12	zcrayfish	libwww is ancient.
2018-10-14 21:13:25	zcrayfish	Someone could definitely write a prettier looking client
2018-10-14 21:13:42	zcrayfish	or even a lame web front-end ( http://gopher.zcrayfish.soy/ <-- also ugly) 
2018-10-14 21:14:13	@benharri	https://gopher.tilde.team
2018-10-14 21:14:21	zcrayfish	(and yes, I have the wide margin on the left in case the browser does not support the file icon display, in which case it resorts to being lynx, HAH)
2018-10-14 21:14:27	@benharri	i added a markdown parser to that bad boy too
2018-10-14 21:15:31	zcrayfish	ooh, HTML 5
2018-10-14 21:22:37	mN4v7lG	this margin still bother me
2018-10-14 21:22:51	@tomasino	hah
2018-10-14 21:22:58	@tomasino	try vf1 then
2018-10-14 21:23:01	@tomasino	it's pretty

2018-10-14 21:24:20	mN4v7lG	although the margin, I think lynx is very pretty
2018-10-14 21:24:34	mN4v7lG	I'll try vf1
2018-10-14 21:29:59	mN4v7lG	naahhh
2018-10-14 21:30:04	mN4v7lG	I prefer lynx

2018-10-14 21:32:58	@tomasino	lynx is great
2018-10-14 21:33:06	@tomasino	vf1 has a very different feel
2018-10-14 21:33:08	@tomasino	REPL like
2018-10-14 21:33:11	zcrayfish	emphasis on web browser: it converts gopher to HTML xD
2018-10-14 21:33:41	mN4v7lG	I like firefox, but lynx
2018-10-14 21:33:56	mN4v7lG	It simply browse the web
2018-10-14 21:34:04	mN4v7lG	that's great
2018-10-14 21:34:18	zcrayfish	Firefox 3.6 double converts............ :/
2018-10-14 21:34:28	zcrayfish	it converts it to some kind of old mozilla specific index...
2018-10-14 21:34:28	mN4v7lG	and I don't need a mouse
2018-10-14 21:34:32	zcrayfish	and then converts it into HTML???
2018-10-14 21:35:47	mN4v7lG	tip for lynx users: search with duckduckgo lite, it's the clearest search engine to use with lynx

2018-10-15 16:53:46	@tomasino	i may have to use captive portal to introduce the site, but not actually have the downloads there. People will need to go to the webpage once connected manually
2018-10-15 16:54:25	@tomasino	but i'll deal with that later when i get home
2018-10-15 16:55:21	+ulcer	ok!

2018-10-15 16:59:50	@tomasino	do you have a lot of stray dogs?
2018-10-15 17:00:39	+ulcer	well. so that's the case. you'll barely get yourself to completely nonindustrial area in any scenario so you may consider it too as you may be accompanied e.g. with children
2018-10-15 17:02:40	+ulcer	in case of disaster you get them abandoned. but yes, if you remember i often whined about dog herds on streets too, just that they are not real threat compared to racy species
2018-10-15 17:08:41	@tomasino	oh! you're talking about in survival situations
2018-10-15 17:08:52	@tomasino	I thought this was related to your trash burning neighbors or something. hahaha
2018-10-15 17:09:35	@tomasino	my "bug-out bag" is much more geared toward temporary issues with public services than all out breakdown of civilization
2018-10-15 17:09:49	+ulcer	last year we had loud case. owner in village left 3 german shepherds without food (traveling or something). same time mil veteran visited relatives with his your daughter. dogs jumped over fence and attacked them. children ran away. he died.

2018-10-19 11:00:45	dbucklin	tomasino: It might be worth mentioning the plethora of gopher clients that are out there.
2018-10-19 11:01:41	dbucklin	I keep hearing that we are stuck with the web browsers we have because creating a new, competitive browser would take too much effort.
2018-10-19 11:02:26	dbucklin	So, the point is that gopher is part of an accessible ecosystem.

2018-10-24 20:48:05	cat	what's shaking ulcer? how's your fish?
2018-10-24 21:09:11	+ulcer	catfishes are doing well.
2018-10-24 21:11:34	+ulcer	i saw at least 6 sturisoma panamese and at least 8 of banjo catfish
2018-10-24 21:12:53	+ulcer	some snails died without giving breed. i didn't invest enough time to learn keeping tricks
2018-10-24 21:18:56	+ulcer	i also tried to drop pufferfish temp to 22 C and they just don't care (lowest recommended on internets is 24-26 with top mentioned 33 deg C)
2018-10-24 21:21:12	+ulcer	i'm afraid they can even survive 18 C.. not sure if i'll try >_> anyway all fishkeeping i do now is experimental
2018-10-24 21:26:18	+ulcer	there are still reasons to try: contrary to description dwarf pufferfish doesn't care about water quality, water flow, even about any aeration. also these 10 1.5 cm parasites are fed with same handful of snails as 30 cichlids

2018-10-29 14:52:11	+concon	ulcer I have jughead, jugtail, veronica that I run already and am looking to use Jugtail for this but thans nice link
2018-10-29 14:53:19	+concon	currently idexing 2.5 million selectors, the file size is 700mb
2018-10-29 14:56:24	+concon	My problem is indexing the user space at SDF
2018-10-29 14:58:59	+concon	My plan was to switch from indexing most of gopher space, or currently about half and switch to only sdf (all of sdf) since V2 and Contrition are handling the other portions of gopherspace but they are not getting in very deeply into SDF either, so that would be a section of gopherspace currently under-served 
2018-10-29 15:01:28	+concon	Jughead is quite capable as it was designed to do just that, I have always pointed the indexing at multiple gophers and merged them into one giant index before building the database and in that manner have used it like a veronica search, I wanted to go back to a single space, as Jonzy originally wrote it
2018-10-29 15:01:48	+concon	namely SDF's :)
2018-10-29 15:02:38	+concon	I tried this 10 years ago several times and several ways, same results I am having now, I believe it's simply the gopher server settings regarding the amount of requests from one IP
2018-10-29 15:02:56	+concon	which kicks me off SDF
2018-10-29 15:09:04	+concon	ulcer: I had to smile though when I used the search engine link you gave, I entered My test search word that would indicate that My gopherspace at sdf had been indexed and I got a single result, it found it... unfortunately it was from the gopher server I ran 10 years ago hehe
2018-10-29 15:10:51	+concon	I think john Gorzen had grabbed the content shortly before I shut that one down
2018-10-29 15:11:00	+concon	and the content was mirrored
2018-10-29 15:41:17	cat	if it is too many connections is it maybe possible to throttle the indexing? i dunno how any of it works haha
2018-10-29 15:50:35	+concon	Hey Cat, yes I did reduce the forking from 5 to one
2018-10-29 15:50:47	+concon	That was my thought too :)
2018-10-29 15:53:03	+concon	still same issue and trying to figure it out from my side was perplexing because I didnt seem to get ( Much) Further
2018-10-29 15:53:27	+concon	I get to 1[04-Feb-2018]             zuz  ADVENTURE: The Gopher Hole of Zuz /users/zuz/ sdf.org 70

2018-10-29 15:53:31	+concon	7GopherSpace SEARCH Engine /v2/vs gopher.floodgap.com 70
2018-10-29 15:54:22	+concon	and at the begining of the database I will get a full index of the lastest users gopherspace, in between is only as above starting with A
2018-10-29 15:54:56	+concon	so it indexes one fully, then all the rest to the end, and typically would then go back and index alphabetically
2018-10-29 15:55:29	+concon	If I leave it at 5 forks I stop around "U"

2018-10-29 15:58:57	+concon	or somehow put pauses in between? Depends if the server is loking at numbers of requests from one IP or numbers by time...I will think on that

2018-11-08 09:07:14	kirch	Twitter's new "Developer Accounts" require your to write an assay to get API keys - and there's no appeal if you don't convince them the first time
2018-11-08 09:07:48	epimorphism	What's the point of having an API then?
2018-11-08 09:08:19	kirch	I've got a bot project that I'm waiting for them to shut down... I keep emailing them through other channels complaining that I can't appeal and that my project is similar to existing products.
2018-11-08 09:09:16	kirch	well, the API never actually replicated Twitter's full functionality -- and hte Facebook API is much much worse, when it comes to being friendly to developers

2018-11-08 09:13:22	kirch	PREACH!
2018-11-08 09:14:06	kirch	like - twitter's original API allowed Tweetdeck to build a business around providing a better UI for twitter.... so Twitter bought them, deleted their native app, and in-housed their web app.
