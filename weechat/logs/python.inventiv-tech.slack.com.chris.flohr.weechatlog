2018-10-31 15:41:24	↪	And if you like (or don't like) what you see, let Jeremy know - getting him some metrics on my performance is handy, not only the good but the bad as well.
2018-10-31 15:46:06	brandon.morse	of course - no worries

2018-10-31 15:52:21	brandon.morse	thanks again - hopefully they won't need anything else on this site for now and i can pull your pm2 stuff into a script to run locally... until we turn it into a webhook and anything that is pushed to develop with automatically get staged

2018-10-31 15:39:37	↪	Sorry for the delay. Many many fires the last few days
2018-10-31 15:40:23	↪	Let me know if you need any changes though - I'm happy to help!
2018-10-31 15:41:24	↪	And if you like (or don't like) what you see, let Jeremy know - getting him some metrics on my performance is handy, not only the good but the bad as well.
2018-10-31 15:46:06	brandon.morse	of course - no worries

2018-10-31 15:46:58	chris.flohr	Happy to bounce around some ideas!
2018-10-31 15:52:21	brandon.morse	thanks again - hopefully they won't need anything else on this site for now and i can pull your pm2 stuff into a script to run locally... until we turn it into a webhook and anything that is pushed to develop with automatically get staged
2018-10-31 15:52:53	chris.flohr	Yup. That's the next step. Shouldn't be too hard with the gitlab runners.

2018-10-15 14:23:32	chris.flohr	Yup!

2018-10-31 15:34:10	brandon.morse	it just happened to be unfortunate timing as the pm2 stuff overwrote a reverted staging
2018-10-31 15:34:33	↪	basically they had an image get updated that wasnt suppose to be updated until after this round of screens 
2018-10-31 15:34:45	↪	i didnt want to revert commits and all that for a 30sec swap
2018-10-31 15:34:59	↪	so i just checked out the commit right before the image was updated and did a stage
2018-10-31 15:35:11	↪	but it looks like the pm2 stuff i need to make sure the git commits are up to snuff 
2018-10-31 15:35:13	↪	is that correct?
2018-10-31 15:35:14	chris.flohr	just move the files around on the server - newest files are hosted from /var/www/DOMAIN/current
2018-10-31 15:35:38	brandon.morse	gotcha
2018-10-31 15:35:45	chris.flohr	But yeah, moving forward, your builds will be based on what's in the HEAD commit in git.

2018-10-31 15:36:22	↪	So optimally, you'll do all of your work in the develop branch and then merge it into master when you're done with QC.
2018-10-31 15:36:24	brandon.morse	yeah - it's like the deployment setup i used to have at my old place
