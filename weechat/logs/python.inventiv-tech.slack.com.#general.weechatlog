2018-06-13 15:28:13		getting channel history...
2018-02-07 10:11:55	jamestomasino	so i think i've got a good setup plan for a 16 servo rig off a single arduino uno. with that i'm either limited to 8 panels on 2-axis mounts or a line of 16.  
2018-02-07 10:12:47	jamestomasino	we have a product that is meant to treat trigger finger and straighten your hand. Brandon and I were scheming about a vid-wall in the shape of a hand that's curled closed until you approach, when it opens flat 
2018-02-07 10:12:58	scott.ellison	sweet.. 
2018-02-07 10:13:11	jamestomasino	i'd need more than one servo for the fingers, but on a single axis 
2018-02-07 10:13:30	scott.ellison	Do you anticipate the uno will have enough ram and speed? 
2018-02-07 10:13:57	scott.ellison	very nice 
2018-02-07 10:14:05	jamestomasino	to just drive the servos, yeah. It won't have anything to do with the displays themselves 
2018-02-07 10:14:37	scott.ellison	there are plenty of backups if you run into issues anway 
2018-02-07 10:14:41	jamestomasino	i'll need a 5amp secondary power supply that can handle the 16 servos. That's gonna be a decent amount of amps in draw 
2018-02-07 10:15:05	scott.ellison	how big are the servos out of curiosity? 
2018-02-07 10:15:36	jamestomasino	not sure what i'll need yet 
2018-02-07 10:15:36	scott.ellison	they must be fairly large no? 
2018-02-07 10:15:54	jamestomasino	if they need to physically lift and position the ipads, yeah, they'll need to be beefy 
2018-02-07 10:16:06	jamestomasino	the first step is a simple prototype 
2018-02-07 10:16:21	scott.ellison	cardboard ipads! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-07 10:16:24	jamestomasino	1) i need to get 4 ipads to sync output on a loop 
2018-02-07 10:16:40	jamestomasino	2) i need to build a sensor array to make the servos move and follow  
2018-02-07 10:16:51	jamestomasino	then we can pitch it and get a real budget to build a real one 
2018-02-07 10:16:59	scott.ellison	noice 
2018-02-07 10:17:03	scott.ellison	thats pretty exciting 
2018-02-07 10:17:20	jamestomasino	i still think the biggest challenge in this is the ipads. I may have to investigate non-ipad video walls and see how easy that would be 
2018-02-07 10:17:36	scott.ellison	ya for sure 
2018-02-07 10:17:53	jamestomasino	the ipads are sitting under my desk, so i want to use them for something, but I doubt i can even plug them into my mac and build something in XCode for them anymore. Apple will bitch and try to update them to an OS they can't handle or something 
2018-02-07 10:17:53	scott.ellison	because of the closed nature of the system correct? 
2018-02-07 10:18:07	scott.ellison	ya for sure 
2018-02-07 10:18:12	jamestomasino	yeah, if this was an android tablet it'd be a different story 
2018-02-07 10:18:15	scott.ellison	the apple catch 22.. 
2018-02-07 10:18:21	jamestomasino	i could install a custom OS if need be 
2018-02-07 10:18:36	jamestomasino	For the ipads, and app is my only option 
2018-02-07 11:23:12	jason	could you do some sort of web app? run it thru chrome on iOS? 
2018-02-07 11:24:06	jason	http://m1interactive.net/work/ipad-video-wall/ 
2018-02-07 11:38:19	scott.ellison	ya.. thats what I was driving at with sockets.. I have done that before to create a questions and answer setup.. any kind of control data can be sent really.. “turn servo on” etc 
2018-02-07 12:18:41	scott.ellison	I used nodejs as a mini server on a mac mini as the server/main presentation display screen.. it controlled the flow of control data through sockets and displayed the leaderboard HTML.. and the iPads wirelessly connected to the same network displayed the player version of the HTML..  (edited)
2018-02-07 12:19:13	jamestomasino	hmmmmm 
2018-02-07 12:44:54	jamestomasino	that would be wildly easier 
2018-02-07 12:44:59	 *	jamestomasino investigates 
2018-02-07 13:10:41	scott.ellison	for the trade shows I brought my own wireless router to ensure stability.. 
2018-02-07 13:11:04	scott.ellison	it stood alone just to serve the mini and the ipads.. no internet access 
2018-02-07 13:11:31	jamestomasino	right, i figured. You run into any interference with all the other crap at a convension? 
2018-02-07 13:11:58	jamestomasino	i'm wary of using the ultrasonic sensors for that reason. Worried I'll get interference from someone elses stuff 
2018-02-07 13:15:07	scott.ellison	I have not run into interference to date. buuuut its always a potential.. in some cases out of fear.. because I could not man the booth.. I used the ethernet trick so the ipad was wired. 
2018-02-07 13:15:18	scott.ellison	no chance of disconnect that way 
2018-02-07 13:15:37	jamestomasino	smart 
2018-02-07 13:16:05	scott.ellison	it was a very fun project.. 
2018-02-07 13:16:20	jamestomasino	just saw some impressive office numbers for your group. Well done 
2018-02-07 13:16:25	jamestomasino	(i'm in a finance review) 
2018-02-07 13:16:36	scott.ellison	cool 
2018-02-07 13:17:13	scott.ellison	still waiting to hear more news for the VR project we sold in.. can’t wait to start that one. 
2018-02-07 13:17:58	jamestomasino	webvr or headset? 
2018-02-07 13:18:26	scott.ellison	headset 
2018-02-07 13:18:31	jamestomasino	sweet! 
2018-02-07 13:19:01	scott.ellison	ya.. Jason was a big part of it as well.. his help was greatly appreciated. 
2018-02-07 13:19:49	jamestomasino	he's a pretty cool dude, but shhh... don't tell him 
2018-02-07 13:21:31	scott.ellison	I am pretty sure he is the standard 98 degrees.. but.. 
2018-02-07 13:21:59	scott.ellison	unless he is sick of course

2018-02-16 10:17:44	scott.ellison	hey folks.. reaching out.. haven’t dealt with veeva vault a lot to date because it has not come up a lot.. mostly CLM sandbox migrations to date.. tried to reach out to my standard veeva support guys through email and all I got was bounce backs.. weird.. Has anyone else experienced this or is it just coincidence. I don’t contact them a lot (no need) so I am surprised. It appears they have all moved on. This leaves me in a spot.. I need to contact them but not sure who to connect with. They didn’t seem to leave a forwarding address. 
2018-02-16 10:20:23	jeremy.scroggs	So I just experienced this recently as well.  Aaron Neal was our contact and was replaced. There was a transition that happened and we were looped in on.  Then the new person left and no one told us.  I use to reach out to David Livingston for Veeva info/contacts and now I have no idea who to contact 
2018-02-16 10:20:51	scott.ellison	:disappointed: 
2018-02-16 10:21:23	jeremy.scroggs	what issue are you having? maybe i can help 
2018-02-16 10:21:36	scott.ellison	I found an additional contact that I am trying now.. Ill let you know how that turns out for sure. A fellow named Jon Fisher.. Apparently he used to work at inventiv. 
2018-02-16 10:23:31	scott.ellison	We are attempting to migrate veeva CRM files to ipsen through promomats. This is not something we normally do so its a little grey. We usualy do the old migration credential through CRM. We have done vault migrations but it involved logging into the clients vault and re-creating the presentations there.. Ipsen is asking for us to create the presentation in our vault and migrate to theirs through vault 
2018-02-16 10:23:50	jason	Before Livingston left, he told me i could always contact Ben West for things local IT couldn't help with: mailto:ben.west@inventivhealth.com (ben.west@inventivhealth.com) 
2018-02-16 10:24:29	scott.ellison	cool.. at least I have a couple of options still! :slightly_smiling_face: croiky! 
2018-02-16 10:25:07	bryan.roman	Hey - justt seeing this

2018-02-16 10:25:27	bryan.roman	Nice guy, he's our GSW NY official rep 
2018-02-16 10:26:15	scott.ellison	cool 
2018-02-16 10:26:59	jeremy.scroggs	We have some folks here who have created presentations via promomats instead of the traditional salesforce, so if you need help on that front, we can probably accommodate.  Let me know if you would like to talk more. 
2018-02-16 10:29:03	scott.ellison	thats great and comforting to know thanks Jeremy!  (edited)
2018-02-16 10:30:09	scott.ellison	appreciate eveyone’s responses..  (edited)

2018-02-16 10:48:30	bryan.roman	Not too bad of a week!  Haven't gotten the post-vacation blues, so much still have the beach on the brain 
2018-02-16 10:49:04	bryan.roman	BTW I have approval to take the NY team down to Newtown, so let's talk on the side about schedule :sunglasses:

2018-02-19 15:34:40	jamestomasino	super cool 
2018-02-19 15:34:53	scott.ellison	I love the whole notion of moving atoms remotely.. 
2018-02-19 15:35:04	jamestomasino	i made a little shell script so i can pipe any stdout into it and it prints all pretty-formatted 
2018-02-19 15:35:18	scott.ellison	nice 
2018-02-19 15:35:30	jamestomasino	fold -sw 32 | escpos-pipe.py blah blah 
2018-02-19 15:36:21	jamestomasino	these things all talk over ESC-POS and libraries for it abound. It's a super simple setup 
2018-02-19 15:37:02	scott.ellison	what I love about MQTT is the speed and stable behavior 
2018-02-19 15:37:28	scott.ellison	and it fits on the tiniest of devices.. 
2018-02-19 15:39:57	jamestomasino	yes! 
2018-02-19 15:40:01	jamestomasino	it's so minimal 
2018-02-19 15:40:25	jamestomasino	I've been playing with it in node-red. So much fun, and such a natural fit 
2018-02-21 14:36:52	jamestomasino	moops 
2018-02-21 14:44:57	jamestomasino	chris, what are our aws hosting charges averaging for a little website? 
2018-02-22 08:38:02	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino Generally speaking, for a micro host with 8G of space, roughly $15-20/mo, not including bandwidth. The more power we add, the more the price goes up, but I can always run a calculation for you if you have something specific in mind.  (edited)
2018-02-22 12:05:34	jamestomasino	nah, that's great. This is a cheapo client who won't have a brand in market until 2020. We're hosting their corporate site, which will probably be 2-5 static pages. Just wanted to ballpark for OOPs 
2018-02-24 19:22:12	jamestomasino	scott.ellison: thinking of building one of these once we get a 3d printer http://org.coloradomesa.edu/~cgtimms/projects.html

2018-02-26 09:32:07	jason	:thinking_face:... send the plans 
2018-02-26 10:38:15	scott.ellison	Thats cool for sure! 
2018-02-26 10:39:22	scott.ellison	it would be cool for a client to comein and see their logo or something relevant on the white board but beautifully "hand drawn"  (edited)
2018-02-26 10:54:44	jamestomasino	looking deeper my only concern is that the illustrations are coded in the arduino directly rather than interpretted by reading a vector format 
2018-02-26 10:55:26	jamestomasino	a pen plotter with a step motor designed to lay on its side may work better for flexibility 
2018-02-26 10:55:36	scott.ellison	you could  probably rig up something to read a pixel file.. not as smooth but it would be cool for it to draw it as slightly larger pixels..  (edited)
2018-02-26 10:56:10	scott.ellison	do the conversion on the pc/mac to an image 
2018-02-26 10:56:31	scott.ellison	give the arduino the bit data..

2018-04-24 10:55:05	jamestomasino	anyone of you guys have capabilities in working with Umbraco 7 CMS? A new client has a legacy site they want to reskin that's in it. 
2018-04-24 10:57:28	scott.ellison	None here 
2018-04-24 12:48:52	scott.ellison	Anyone off the top of their head remember how the shared resource works in Veeva CLM? its been so long. .I can't remember the syntax and naming conventions. 
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!
2018-06-01 10:38:05		**Please add to thread with ideas to keep them all in one place 
2018-06-05 09:43:18	jamestomasino	ahh, there we go 
2018-06-05 09:43:25	jamestomasino	wee-slack plugin 
2018-06-05 09:45:44	jamestomasino	did anyone invite Thomas Hillhouse here yet? 
2018-06-05 11:34:45	jamestomasino	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform? 
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff. 
2018-06-05 12:01:27	chris.flohr	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there 
2018-06-05 12:02:11	chris.flohr	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches. 
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome 
2018-06-06 10:22:13	jamestomasino	i need to learn more about kubernetes 
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod. 
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo 
2018-06-06 10:41:43	jamestomasino	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	chris.flohr	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there. 
2018-06-06 10:45:43	chris.flohr	Good learning opportunity though. 
2018-06-06 10:46:50	chris.flohr	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running. 
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out 
2018-06-13 15:28:13		getting channel history...
2018-02-07 10:11:55	jamestomasino	so i think i've got a good setup plan for a 16 servo rig off a single arduino uno. with that i'm either limited to 8 panels on 2-axis mounts or a line of 16.  
2018-02-07 10:12:47	jamestomasino	we have a product that is meant to treat trigger finger and straighten your hand. Brandon and I were scheming about a vid-wall in the shape of a hand that's curled closed until you approach, when it opens flat 
2018-02-07 10:12:58	scott.ellison	sweet.. 
2018-02-07 10:13:11	jamestomasino	i'd need more than one servo for the fingers, but on a single axis 
2018-02-07 10:13:30	scott.ellison	Do you anticipate the uno will have enough ram and speed? 
2018-02-07 10:13:57	scott.ellison	very nice 
2018-02-07 10:14:05	jamestomasino	to just drive the servos, yeah. It won't have anything to do with the displays themselves 
2018-02-07 10:14:37	scott.ellison	there are plenty of backups if you run into issues anway 
2018-02-07 10:14:41	jamestomasino	i'll need a 5amp secondary power supply that can handle the 16 servos. That's gonna be a decent amount of amps in draw 
2018-02-07 10:15:05	scott.ellison	how big are the servos out of curiosity? 
2018-02-07 10:15:36	jamestomasino	not sure what i'll need yet 
2018-02-07 10:15:36	scott.ellison	they must be fairly large no? 
2018-02-07 10:15:54	jamestomasino	if they need to physically lift and position the ipads, yeah, they'll need to be beefy 
2018-02-07 10:16:06	jamestomasino	the first step is a simple prototype 
2018-02-07 10:16:21	scott.ellison	cardboard ipads! :slightly_smiling_face: 
2018-02-07 10:16:24	jamestomasino	1) i need to get 4 ipads to sync output on a loop 
2018-02-07 10:16:40	jamestomasino	2) i need to build a sensor array to make the servos move and follow  
2018-02-07 10:16:51	jamestomasino	then we can pitch it and get a real budget to build a real one 
2018-02-07 10:16:59	scott.ellison	noice 
2018-02-07 10:17:03	scott.ellison	thats pretty exciting 
2018-02-07 10:17:20	jamestomasino	i still think the biggest challenge in this is the ipads. I may have to investigate non-ipad video walls and see how easy that would be 
2018-02-07 10:17:36	scott.ellison	ya for sure 
2018-02-07 10:17:53	jamestomasino	the ipads are sitting under my desk, so i want to use them for something, but I doubt i can even plug them into my mac and build something in XCode for them anymore. Apple will bitch and try to update them to an OS they can't handle or something 
2018-02-07 10:17:53	scott.ellison	because of the closed nature of the system correct? 
2018-02-07 10:18:07	scott.ellison	ya for sure 
2018-02-07 10:18:12	jamestomasino	yeah, if this was an android tablet it'd be a different story 
2018-02-07 10:18:15	scott.ellison	the apple catch 22.. 
2018-02-07 10:18:21	jamestomasino	i could install a custom OS if need be 
2018-02-07 10:18:36	jamestomasino	For the ipads, and app is my only option 
2018-02-07 11:23:12	jason	could you do some sort of web app? run it thru chrome on iOS? 
2018-02-07 11:24:06	jason	http://m1interactive.net/work/ipad-video-wall/ 
2018-02-07 11:38:19	scott.ellison	ya.. thats what I was driving at with sockets.. I have done that before to create a questions and answer setup.. any kind of control data can be sent really.. “turn servo on” etc 
2018-02-07 12:18:41	scott.ellison	I used nodejs as a mini server on a mac mini as the server/main presentation display screen.. it controlled the flow of control data through sockets and displayed the leaderboard HTML.. and the iPads wirelessly connected to the same network displayed the player version of the HTML..  (edited)
2018-02-07 12:19:13	jamestomasino	hmmmmm 
2018-02-07 12:44:54	jamestomasino	that would be wildly easier 
2018-02-07 12:44:59	 *	jamestomasino investigates 
2018-02-07 13:10:41	scott.ellison	for the trade shows I brought my own wireless router to ensure stability.. 
2018-02-07 13:11:04	scott.ellison	it stood alone just to serve the mini and the ipads.. no internet access 
2018-02-07 13:11:31	jamestomasino	right, i figured. You run into any interference with all the other crap at a convension? 
2018-02-07 13:11:58	jamestomasino	i'm wary of using the ultrasonic sensors for that reason. Worried I'll get interference from someone elses stuff 
2018-02-07 13:15:07	scott.ellison	I have not run into interference to date. buuuut its always a potential.. in some cases out of fear.. because I could not man the booth.. I used the ethernet trick so the ipad was wired. 
2018-02-07 13:15:18	scott.ellison	no chance of disconnect that way 
2018-02-07 13:15:37	jamestomasino	smart 
2018-02-07 13:16:05	scott.ellison	it was a very fun project.. 
2018-02-07 13:16:20	jamestomasino	just saw some impressive office numbers for your group. Well done 
2018-02-07 13:16:25	jamestomasino	(i'm in a finance review)

2018-02-07 13:17:13	scott.ellison	still waiting to hear more news for the VR project we sold in.. can’t wait to start that one. 
2018-02-07 13:17:58	jamestomasino	webvr or headset? 
2018-02-07 13:18:26	scott.ellison	headset

2018-02-07 13:19:01	scott.ellison	ya.. Jason was a big part of it as well.. his help was greatly appreciated. 
2018-02-07 13:19:49	jamestomasino	he's a pretty cool dude, but shhh... don't tell him

2018-02-16 10:17:44	scott.ellison	hey folks.. reaching out.. haven’t dealt with veeva vault a lot to date because it has not come up a lot.. mostly CLM sandbox migrations to date.. tried to reach out to my standard veeva support guys through email and all I got was bounce backs.. weird.. Has anyone else experienced this or is it just coincidence. I don’t contact them a lot (no need) so I am surprised. It appears they have all moved on. This leaves me in a spot.. I need to contact them but not sure who to connect with. They didn’t seem to leave a forwarding address. 
2018-02-16 10:20:23	jeremy.scroggs	So I just experienced this recently as well.  Aaron Neal was our contact and was replaced. There was a transition that happened and we were looped in on.  Then the new person left and no one told us.  I use to reach out to David Livingston for Veeva info/contacts and now I have no idea who to contact 
2018-02-16 10:20:51	scott.ellison	:disappointed: 
2018-02-16 10:21:23	jeremy.scroggs	what issue are you having? maybe i can help 
2018-02-16 10:21:36	scott.ellison	I found an additional contact that I am trying now.. Ill let you know how that turns out for sure. A fellow named Jon Fisher.. Apparently he used to work at inventiv. 
2018-02-16 10:23:31	scott.ellison	We are attempting to migrate veeva CRM files to ipsen through promomats. This is not something we normally do so its a little grey. We usualy do the old migration credential through CRM. We have done vault migrations but it involved logging into the clients vault and re-creating the presentations there.. Ipsen is asking for us to create the presentation in our vault and migrate to theirs through vault 
2018-02-16 10:23:50	jason	Before Livingston left, he told me i could always contact Ben West for things local IT couldn't help with: mailto:ben.west@inventivhealth.com (ben.west@inventivhealth.com) 
2018-02-16 10:24:29	scott.ellison	cool.. at least I have a couple of options still! :slightly_smiling_face: croiky!

2018-02-16 10:26:15	scott.ellison	cool 
2018-02-16 10:26:59	jeremy.scroggs	We have some folks here who have created presentations via promomats instead of the traditional salesforce, so if you need help on that front, we can probably accommodate.  Let me know if you would like to talk more. 
2018-02-16 10:29:03	scott.ellison	thats great and comforting to know thanks Jeremy!  (edited)

2018-02-19 15:34:40	jamestomasino	super cool 
2018-02-19 15:34:53	scott.ellison	I love the whole notion of moving atoms remotely.. 
2018-02-19 15:35:04	jamestomasino	i made a little shell script so i can pipe any stdout into it and it prints all pretty-formatted

2018-02-19 15:37:02	scott.ellison	what I love about MQTT is the speed and stable behavior 
2018-02-19 15:37:28	scott.ellison	and it fits on the tiniest of devices.. 
2018-02-19 15:39:57	jamestomasino	yes! 
2018-02-19 15:40:01	jamestomasino	it's so minimal 
2018-02-19 15:40:25	jamestomasino	I've been playing with it in node-red. So much fun, and such a natural fit 
2018-02-21 14:36:52	jamestomasino	moops 
2018-02-21 14:44:57	jamestomasino	chris, what are our aws hosting charges averaging for a little website? 
2018-02-22 08:38:02	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino Generally speaking, for a micro host with 8G of space, roughly $15-20/mo, not including bandwidth. The more power we add, the more the price goes up, but I can always run a calculation for you if you have something specific in mind.  (edited)
2018-02-22 12:05:34	jamestomasino	nah, that's great. This is a cheapo client who won't have a brand in market until 2020. We're hosting their corporate site, which will probably be 2-5 static pages. Just wanted to ballpark for OOPs 
2018-02-24 19:22:12	jamestomasino	scott.ellison: thinking of building one of these once we get a 3d printer http://org.coloradomesa.edu/~cgtimms/projects.html

2018-02-26 10:38:15	scott.ellison	Thats cool for sure! 
2018-02-26 10:39:22	scott.ellison	it would be cool for a client to comein and see their logo or something relevant on the white board but beautifully "hand drawn"  (edited)
2018-02-26 10:54:44	jamestomasino	looking deeper my only concern is that the illustrations are coded in the arduino directly rather than interpretted by reading a vector format 
2018-02-26 10:55:26	jamestomasino	a pen plotter with a step motor designed to lay on its side may work better for flexibility 
2018-02-26 10:55:36	scott.ellison	you could  probably rig up something to read a pixel file.. not as smooth but it would be cool for it to draw it as slightly larger pixels..  (edited)

2018-03-16 15:43:26	jamestomasino	hey ken, what are you guys using for your pitch websites? do you have a bootstrap template you're plugging data into or is it a custom build for each pitch? 
2018-03-20 10:48:36	jamestomasino	Your Enterprise Edition license will expire in 31 days. -- message from gitlab this morning

2018-04-02 11:29:50	bryan.roman	QUICK Q, is Syneos/GSW/Navicor Veeva Level 4 certified? 
2018-04-02 12:22:13	jamestomasino	We have had it at various times, but the certs expire 
2018-04-02 12:22:21	jamestomasino	i don't  think we have any but myinsights active right now 
2018-04-02 12:22:35	jamestomasino	Adam would know better. His team typically does the certing 
2018-04-02 12:22:58	jamestomasino	when clients ask I usually feed them that line 
2018-04-02 12:35:21	jeremy.scroggs	we are currently not certified - all certs have expired 
2018-04-02 16:03:29	bryan.roman	thanks guys 
2018-04-03 12:10:05	jamestomasino	hey guys, we're doing some award submissions. Do you have a template you guys are using for those submissions?

2018-04-24 10:55:05	jamestomasino	anyone of you guys have capabilities in working with Umbraco 7 CMS? A new client has a legacy site they want to reskin that's in it. 
2018-04-24 10:57:28	scott.ellison	None here 
2018-04-24 12:48:52	scott.ellison	Anyone off the top of their head remember how the shared resource works in Veeva CLM? its been so long. .I can't remember the syntax and naming conventions. 
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 09:45:44	jamestomasino	did anyone invite Thomas Hillhouse here yet? 
2018-06-05 11:34:45	jamestomasino	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform? 
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff. 
2018-06-05 12:01:27	chris.flohr	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there 
2018-06-05 12:02:11	chris.flohr	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches. 
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome 
2018-06-06 10:22:13	jamestomasino	i need to learn more about kubernetes 
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod. 
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo 
2018-06-06 10:41:43	jamestomasino	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	chris.flohr	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there. 
2018-06-06 10:45:43	chris.flohr	Good learning opportunity though. 
2018-06-06 10:46:50	chris.flohr	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running. 
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out 
2018-08-02 10:17:43		getting channel history...

2018-02-07 13:16:36	scott.ellison	cool 
2018-02-07 13:17:13	“↳”	still waiting to hear more news for the VR project we sold in.. can’t wait to start that one. 
2018-02-07 13:17:58	jamestomasino	webvr or headset? 
2018-02-07 13:18:26	scott.ellison	headset 
2018-02-07 13:18:31	jamestomasino	sweet! 
2018-02-07 13:19:01	scott.ellison	ya.. Jason was a big part of it as well.. his help was greatly appreciated. 
2018-02-07 13:19:49	jamestomasino	he's a pretty cool dude, but shhh... don't tell him 
2018-02-07 13:21:31	scott.ellison	I am pretty sure he is the standard 98 degrees.. but..

2018-02-16 10:17:44	“↳”	hey folks.. reaching out.. haven’t dealt with veeva vault a lot to date because it has not come up a lot.. mostly CLM sandbox migrations to date.. tried to reach out to my standard veeva support guys through email and all I got was bounce backs.. weird.. Has anyone else experienced this or is it just coincidence. I don’t contact them a lot (no need) so I am surprised. It appears they have all moved on. This leaves me in a spot.. I need to contact them but not sure who to connect with. They didn’t seem to leave a forwarding address. 
2018-02-16 10:20:23	jeremy.scroggs	So I just experienced this recently as well.  Aaron Neal was our contact and was replaced. There was a transition that happened and we were looped in on.  Then the new person left and no one told us.  I use to reach out to David Livingston for Veeva info/contacts and now I have no idea who to contact 
2018-02-16 10:20:51	scott.ellison	:disappointed: 
2018-02-16 10:21:23	jeremy.scroggs	what issue are you having? maybe i can help 
2018-02-16 10:21:36	scott.ellison	I found an additional contact that I am trying now.. Ill let you know how that turns out for sure. A fellow named Jon Fisher.. Apparently he used to work at inventiv. 
2018-02-16 10:23:31	“↳”	We are attempting to migrate veeva CRM files to ipsen through promomats. This is not something we normally do so its a little grey. We usualy do the old migration credential through CRM. We have done vault migrations but it involved logging into the clients vault and re-creating the presentations there.. Ipsen is asking for us to create the presentation in our vault and migrate to theirs through vault 
2018-02-16 10:23:50	jason	Before Livingston left, he told me i could always contact Ben West for things local IT couldn't help with: mailto:ben.west@inventivhealth.com (ben.west@inventivhealth.com) 
2018-02-16 10:24:29	scott.ellison	cool.. at least I have a couple of options still! :slightly_smiling_face: croiky!

2018-02-16 10:26:15	scott.ellison	cool 
2018-02-16 10:26:59	jeremy.scroggs	We have some folks here who have created presentations via promomats instead of the traditional salesforce, so if you need help on that front, we can probably accommodate.  Let me know if you would like to talk more. 
2018-02-16 10:29:03	scott.ellison	thats great and comforting to know thanks Jeremy!  (edited)

2018-02-19 15:34:53	scott.ellison	I love the whole notion of moving atoms remotely.. 
2018-02-19 15:35:04	jamestomasino	i made a little shell script so i can pipe any stdout into it and it prints all pretty-formatted

2018-02-19 15:39:57	jamestomasino	yes! 
2018-02-19 15:40:01	“↳”	it's so minimal 
2018-02-19 15:40:25	“↳”	I've been playing with it in node-red. So much fun, and such a natural fit

2018-02-21 14:44:57	“↳”	chris, what are our aws hosting charges averaging for a little website? 
2018-02-22 08:38:02	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino Generally speaking, for a micro host with 8G of space, roughly $15-20/mo, not including bandwidth. The more power we add, the more the price goes up, but I can always run a calculation for you if you have something specific in mind.  (edited)
2018-02-22 12:05:34	jamestomasino	nah, that's great. This is a cheapo client who won't have a brand in market until 2020. We're hosting their corporate site, which will probably be 2-5 static pages. Just wanted to ballpark for OOPs

2018-02-26 10:38:15	scott.ellison	Thats cool for sure! 
2018-02-26 10:39:22	“↳”	it would be cool for a client to comein and see their logo or something relevant on the white board but beautifully "hand drawn"  (edited)
2018-02-26 10:54:44	jamestomasino	looking deeper my only concern is that the illustrations are coded in the arduino directly rather than interpretted by reading a vector format 
2018-02-26 10:55:26	“↳”	a pen plotter with a step motor designed to lay on its side may work better for flexibility 
2018-02-26 10:55:36	scott.ellison	you could  probably rig up something to read a pixel file.. not as smooth but it would be cool for it to draw it as slightly larger pixels..  (edited)

2018-04-24 10:55:05	jamestomasino	anyone of you guys have capabilities in working with Umbraco 7 CMS? A new client has a legacy site they want to reskin that's in it. 
2018-04-24 10:57:28	scott.ellison	None here 
2018-04-24 12:48:52	“↳”	Anyone off the top of their head remember how the shared resource works in Veeva CLM? its been so long. .I can't remember the syntax and naming conventions. 
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 09:45:44	“↳”	did anyone invite Thomas Hillhouse here yet? 
2018-06-05 11:34:45	“↳”	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform? 
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff. 
2018-06-05 12:01:27	“↳”	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there 
2018-06-05 12:02:11	“↳”	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches. 
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome 
2018-06-06 10:22:13	“↳”	i need to learn more about kubernetes 
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod. 
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo 
2018-06-06 10:41:43	“↳”	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	“↳”	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there. 
2018-06-06 10:45:43	“↳”	Good learning opportunity though. 
2018-06-06 10:46:50	“↳”	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running. 
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience? 
2018-08-02 09:35:12	“↳”	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired. 
2018-08-02 09:35:37	“↳”	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct? 
2018-08-02 09:36:05	“↳”	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything? 
2018-08-02 09:36:10	“↳”	New territory for us here 
2018-08-02 09:37:50	“↳”	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps 
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA. 
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.

2018-02-16 10:17:44	“↳”	hey folks.. reaching out.. haven’t dealt with veeva vault a lot to date because it has not come up a lot.. mostly CLM sandbox migrations to date.. tried to reach out to my standard veeva support guys through email and all I got was bounce backs.. weird.. Has anyone else experienced this or is it just coincidence. I don’t contact them a lot (no need) so I am surprised. It appears they have all moved on. This leaves me in a spot.. I need to contact them but not sure who to connect with. They didn’t seem to leave a forwarding address. 
2018-02-16 10:20:23	jeremy.scroggs	So I just experienced this recently as well.  Aaron Neal was our contact and was replaced. There was a transition that happened and we were looped in on.  Then the new person left and no one told us.  I use to reach out to David Livingston for Veeva info/contacts and now I have no idea who to contact 
2018-02-16 10:20:51	scott.ellison	:disappointed: 
2018-02-16 10:21:23	jeremy.scroggs	what issue are you having? maybe i can help 
2018-02-16 10:21:36	scott.ellison	I found an additional contact that I am trying now.. Ill let you know how that turns out for sure. A fellow named Jon Fisher.. Apparently he used to work at inventiv. 
2018-02-16 10:23:31	“↳”	We are attempting to migrate veeva CRM files to ipsen through promomats. This is not something we normally do so its a little grey. We usualy do the old migration credential through CRM. We have done vault migrations but it involved logging into the clients vault and re-creating the presentations there.. Ipsen is asking for us to create the presentation in our vault and migrate to theirs through vault 
2018-02-16 10:23:50	jason	Before Livingston left, he told me i could always contact Ben West for things local IT couldn't help with: mailto:ben.west@inventivhealth.com (ben.west@inventivhealth.com) 
2018-02-16 10:24:29	scott.ellison	cool.. at least I have a couple of options still! :slightly_smiling_face: croiky!

2018-02-16 10:26:59	jeremy.scroggs	We have some folks here who have created presentations via promomats instead of the traditional salesforce, so if you need help on that front, we can probably accommodate.  Let me know if you would like to talk more.

2018-02-22 08:38:02	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino Generally speaking, for a micro host with 8G of space, roughly $15-20/mo, not including bandwidth. The more power we add, the more the price goes up, but I can always run a calculation for you if you have something specific in mind.  (edited)
2018-02-22 12:05:34	jamestomasino	nah, that's great. This is a cheapo client who won't have a brand in market until 2020. We're hosting their corporate site, which will probably be 2-5 static pages. Just wanted to ballpark for OOPs

2018-02-26 10:54:44	jamestomasino	looking deeper my only concern is that the illustrations are coded in the arduino directly rather than interpretted by reading a vector format

2018-02-26 10:55:36	scott.ellison	you could  probably rig up something to read a pixel file.. not as smooth but it would be cool for it to draw it as slightly larger pixels..  (edited)

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff. 
2018-06-05 12:01:27	“↳”	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there 
2018-06-05 12:02:11	“↳”	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches. 
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome 
2018-06-06 10:22:13	“↳”	i need to learn more about kubernetes 
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod. 
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo 
2018-06-06 10:41:43	“↳”	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	“↳”	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there. 
2018-06-06 10:45:43	“↳”	Good learning opportunity though. 
2018-06-06 10:46:50	“↳”	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running. 
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience? 
2018-08-02 09:35:12	“↳”	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired. 
2018-08-02 09:35:37	“↳”	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct? 
2018-08-02 09:36:05	“↳”	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything? 
2018-08-02 09:36:10	“↳”	New territory for us here 
2018-08-02 09:37:50	“↳”	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps 
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA. 
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign. 
2018-08-09 13:46:13	“↳”	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning? 
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete. 
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-02-16 10:17:44	scott.ellison	hey folks.. reaching out.. haven’t dealt with veeva vault a lot to date because it has not come up a lot.. mostly CLM sandbox migrations to date.. tried to reach out to my standard veeva support guys through email and all I got was bounce backs.. weird.. Has anyone else experienced this or is it just coincidence. I don’t contact them a lot (no need) so I am surprised. It appears they have all moved on. This leaves me in a spot.. I need to contact them but not sure who to connect with. They didn’t seem to leave a forwarding address. 
2018-02-16 10:20:23	jeremy.scroggs	So I just experienced this recently as well.  Aaron Neal was our contact and was replaced. There was a transition that happened and we were looped in on.  Then the new person left and no one told us.  I use to reach out to David Livingston for Veeva info/contacts and now I have no idea who to contact 
2018-02-16 10:20:51	scott.ellison	:disappointed: 
2018-02-16 10:21:23	jeremy.scroggs	what issue are you having? maybe i can help 
2018-02-16 10:21:36	scott.ellison	I found an additional contact that I am trying now.. Ill let you know how that turns out for sure. A fellow named Jon Fisher.. Apparently he used to work at inventiv. 
2018-02-16 10:23:31	“↳”	We are attempting to migrate veeva CRM files to ipsen through promomats. This is not something we normally do so its a little grey. We usualy do the old migration credential through CRM. We have done vault migrations but it involved logging into the clients vault and re-creating the presentations there.. Ipsen is asking for us to create the presentation in our vault and migrate to theirs through vault 
2018-02-16 10:23:50	jason	Before Livingston left, he told me i could always contact Ben West for things local IT couldn't help with: mailto:ben.west@inventivhealth.com (ben.west@inventivhealth.com)

2018-02-19 15:35:04	jamestomasino	i made a little shell script so i can pipe any stdout into it and it prints all pretty-formatted 
2018-02-19 15:35:18	scott.ellison	nice 
2018-02-19 15:35:30	jamestomasino	fold -sw 32 | escpos-pipe.py blah blah 
2018-02-19 15:36:21	“↳”	these things all talk over ESC-POS and libraries for it abound. It's a super simple setup 
2018-02-19 15:37:02	scott.ellison	what I love about MQTT is the speed and stable behavior 
2018-02-19 15:37:28	“↳”	and it fits on the tiniest of devices.. 
2018-02-19 15:39:57	jamestomasino	yes! 
2018-02-19 15:40:01	“↳”	it's so minimal 
2018-02-19 15:40:25	“↳”	I've been playing with it in node-red. So much fun, and such a natural fit 
2018-02-21 14:36:52	“↳”	moops 
2018-02-21 14:44:57	“↳”	chris, what are our aws hosting charges averaging for a little website? 
2018-02-22 08:38:02	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino Generally speaking, for a micro host with 8G of space, roughly $15-20/mo, not including bandwidth. The more power we add, the more the price goes up, but I can always run a calculation for you if you have something specific in mind.  (edited)
2018-02-22 12:05:34	jamestomasino	nah, that's great. This is a cheapo client who won't have a brand in market until 2020. We're hosting their corporate site, which will probably be 2-5 static pages. Just wanted to ballpark for OOPs

2018-02-26 10:38:15	scott.ellison	Thats cool for sure! 
2018-02-26 10:39:22	“↳”	it would be cool for a client to comein and see their logo or something relevant on the white board but beautifully "hand drawn"  (edited)
2018-02-26 10:54:44	jamestomasino	looking deeper my only concern is that the illustrations are coded in the arduino directly rather than interpretted by reading a vector format 
2018-02-26 10:55:26	“↳”	a pen plotter with a step motor designed to lay on its side may work better for flexibility 
2018-02-26 10:55:36	scott.ellison	you could  probably rig up something to read a pixel file.. not as smooth but it would be cool for it to draw it as slightly larger pixels..  (edited)
2018-02-26 10:56:10	“↳”	do the conversion on the pc/mac to an image 
2018-02-26 10:56:31	“↳”	give the arduino the bit data..

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff. 
2018-06-05 12:01:27	“↳”	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there 
2018-06-05 12:02:11	“↳”	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches. 
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome 
2018-06-06 10:22:13	“↳”	i need to learn more about kubernetes 
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod. 
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo 
2018-06-06 10:41:43	“↳”	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	“↳”	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there. 
2018-06-06 10:45:43	“↳”	Good learning opportunity though. 
2018-06-06 10:46:50	“↳”	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running. 
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience? 
2018-08-02 09:35:12	“↳”	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired. 
2018-08-02 09:35:37	“↳”	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct? 
2018-08-02 09:36:05	“↳”	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything? 
2018-08-02 09:36:10	“↳”	New territory for us here 
2018-08-02 09:37:50	“↳”	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps 
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA. 
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign. 
2018-08-09 13:46:13	“↳”	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning? 
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete. 
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-02-16 10:17:44	scott.ellison	hey folks.. reaching out.. haven’t dealt with veeva vault a lot to date because it has not come up a lot.. mostly CLM sandbox migrations to date.. tried to reach out to my standard veeva support guys through email and all I got was bounce backs.. weird.. Has anyone else experienced this or is it just coincidence. I don’t contact them a lot (no need) so I am surprised. It appears they have all moved on. This leaves me in a spot.. I need to contact them but not sure who to connect with. They didn’t seem to leave a forwarding address. 
2018-02-16 10:20:23	jeremy.scroggs	So I just experienced this recently as well.  Aaron Neal was our contact and was replaced. There was a transition that happened and we were looped in on.  Then the new person left and no one told us.  I use to reach out to David Livingston for Veeva info/contacts and now I have no idea who to contact 
2018-02-16 10:20:51	scott.ellison	:disappointed: 
2018-02-16 10:21:23	jeremy.scroggs	what issue are you having? maybe i can help 
2018-02-16 10:21:36	scott.ellison	I found an additional contact that I am trying now.. Ill let you know how that turns out for sure. A fellow named Jon Fisher.. Apparently he used to work at inventiv. 
2018-02-16 10:23:31	“↳”	We are attempting to migrate veeva CRM files to ipsen through promomats. This is not something we normally do so its a little grey. We usualy do the old migration credential through CRM. We have done vault migrations but it involved logging into the clients vault and re-creating the presentations there.. Ipsen is asking for us to create the presentation in our vault and migrate to theirs through vault 
2018-02-16 10:23:50	jason	Before Livingston left, he told me i could always contact Ben West for things local IT couldn't help with: mailto:ben.west@inventivhealth.com (ben.west@inventivhealth.com)

2018-02-19 15:35:04	jamestomasino	i made a little shell script so i can pipe any stdout into it and it prints all pretty-formatted

2018-02-21 14:44:57	“↳”	chris, what are our aws hosting charges averaging for a little website? 
2018-02-22 08:38:02	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino Generally speaking, for a micro host with 8G of space, roughly $15-20/mo, not including bandwidth. The more power we add, the more the price goes up, but I can always run a calculation for you if you have something specific in mind.  (edited)
2018-02-22 12:05:34	jamestomasino	nah, that's great. This is a cheapo client who won't have a brand in market until 2020. We're hosting their corporate site, which will probably be 2-5 static pages. Just wanted to ballpark for OOPs

2018-02-26 10:39:22	“↳”	it would be cool for a client to comein and see their logo or something relevant on the white board but beautifully "hand drawn"  (edited)
2018-02-26 10:54:44	jamestomasino	looking deeper my only concern is that the illustrations are coded in the arduino directly rather than interpretted by reading a vector format 
2018-02-26 10:55:26	“↳”	a pen plotter with a step motor designed to lay on its side may work better for flexibility 
2018-02-26 10:55:36	scott.ellison	you could  probably rig up something to read a pixel file.. not as smooth but it would be cool for it to draw it as slightly larger pixels..  (edited)

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff. 
2018-06-05 12:01:27	“↳”	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there 
2018-06-05 12:02:11	“↳”	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches. 
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome 
2018-06-06 10:22:13	“↳”	i need to learn more about kubernetes 
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod. 
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo 
2018-06-06 10:41:43	“↳”	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	“↳”	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there. 
2018-06-06 10:45:43	“↳”	Good learning opportunity though. 
2018-06-06 10:46:50	“↳”	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running. 
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience? 
2018-08-02 09:35:12	“↳”	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired. 
2018-08-02 09:35:37	“↳”	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct? 
2018-08-02 09:36:05	“↳”	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything? 
2018-08-02 09:36:10	“↳”	New territory for us here 
2018-08-02 09:37:50	“↳”	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps 
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA. 
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign. 
2018-08-09 13:46:13	“↳”	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning? 
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.

2018-02-19 15:34:53	scott.ellison	I love the whole notion of moving atoms remotely.. 
2018-02-19 15:35:04	jamestomasino	i made a little shell script so i can pipe any stdout into it and it prints all pretty-formatted

2018-02-21 14:36:52	“↳”	moops 
2018-02-21 14:44:57	“↳”	chris, what are our aws hosting charges averaging for a little website? 
2018-02-22 08:38:02	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino Generally speaking, for a micro host with 8G of space, roughly $15-20/mo, not including bandwidth. The more power we add, the more the price goes up, but I can always run a calculation for you if you have something specific in mind.  (edited)
2018-02-22 12:05:34	jamestomasino	nah, that's great. This is a cheapo client who won't have a brand in market until 2020. We're hosting their corporate site, which will probably be 2-5 static pages. Just wanted to ballpark for OOPs

2018-02-26 10:38:15	scott.ellison	Thats cool for sure! 
2018-02-26 10:39:22	“↳”	it would be cool for a client to comein and see their logo or something relevant on the white board but beautifully "hand drawn"  (edited)
2018-02-26 10:54:44	jamestomasino	looking deeper my only concern is that the illustrations are coded in the arduino directly rather than interpretted by reading a vector format 
2018-02-26 10:55:26	“↳”	a pen plotter with a step motor designed to lay on its side may work better for flexibility 
2018-02-26 10:55:36	scott.ellison	you could  probably rig up something to read a pixel file.. not as smooth but it would be cool for it to draw it as slightly larger pixels..  (edited)

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff. 
2018-06-05 12:01:27	“↳”	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there 
2018-06-05 12:02:11	“↳”	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches. 
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome 
2018-06-06 10:22:13	“↳”	i need to learn more about kubernetes 
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod. 
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo 
2018-06-06 10:41:43	“↳”	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	“↳”	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there. 
2018-06-06 10:45:43	“↳”	Good learning opportunity though. 
2018-06-06 10:46:50	“↳”	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running. 
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience? 
2018-08-02 09:35:12	“↳”	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired. 
2018-08-02 09:35:37	“↳”	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct? 
2018-08-02 09:36:05	“↳”	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything? 
2018-08-02 09:36:10	“↳”	New territory for us here 
2018-08-02 09:37:50	“↳”	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps 
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA. 
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign. 
2018-08-09 13:46:13	“↳”	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning? 
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up.

2018-08-15 14:46:49	“↳”	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints 
2018-08-15 14:47:19	“↳”	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel? 
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 14:53:57	“↳”	the art team in Philly has confused itself about your design specs

2018-08-15 14:54:35	scott.ellison	hmm weird. they seemed good with everything yesterday

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc). 
2018-08-15 15:39:57	“↳”	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though 
2018-08-15 15:40:05	“↳”	but why are they calling ICS? 
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think. 
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too 
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented. 
2018-08-15 15:48:12	“↳”	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-02-22 08:38:02	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino Generally speaking, for a micro host with 8G of space, roughly $15-20/mo, not including bandwidth. The more power we add, the more the price goes up, but I can always run a calculation for you if you have something specific in mind.  (edited)
2018-02-22 12:05:34	jamestomasino	nah, that's great. This is a cheapo client who won't have a brand in market until 2020. We're hosting their corporate site, which will probably be 2-5 static pages. Just wanted to ballpark for OOPs

2018-02-26 10:39:22	“↳”	it would be cool for a client to comein and see their logo or something relevant on the white board but beautifully "hand drawn"  (edited)
2018-02-26 10:54:44	jamestomasino	looking deeper my only concern is that the illustrations are coded in the arduino directly rather than interpretted by reading a vector format 
2018-02-26 10:55:26	“↳”	a pen plotter with a step motor designed to lay on its side may work better for flexibility 
2018-02-26 10:55:36	scott.ellison	you could  probably rig up something to read a pixel file.. not as smooth but it would be cool for it to draw it as slightly larger pixels..  (edited)

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:01:27	“↳”	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there 
2018-06-05 12:02:11	“↳”	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches. 
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome 
2018-06-06 10:22:13	“↳”	i need to learn more about kubernetes 
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod. 
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo 
2018-06-06 10:41:43	“↳”	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	“↳”	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there. 
2018-06-06 10:45:43	“↳”	Good learning opportunity though. 
2018-06-06 10:46:50	“↳”	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running. 
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience? 
2018-08-02 09:35:12	“↳”	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired. 
2018-08-02 09:35:37	“↳”	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct? 
2018-08-02 09:36:05	“↳”	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything? 
2018-08-02 09:36:10	“↳”	New territory for us here 
2018-08-02 09:37:50	“↳”	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps 
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA. 
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign. 
2018-08-09 13:46:13	“↳”	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning? 
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete. 
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	“↳”	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints 
2018-08-15 14:47:19	“↳”	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?

2018-08-15 14:53:57	“↳”	the art team in Philly has confused itself about your design specs

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc). 
2018-08-15 15:39:57	“↳”	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though 
2018-08-15 15:40:05	“↳”	but why are they calling ICS? 
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think. 
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too 
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented. 
2018-08-15 15:48:12	“↳”	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:41:43	“↳”	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	“↳”	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.

2018-06-06 10:46:50	“↳”	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience? 
2018-08-02 09:35:12	“↳”	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired. 
2018-08-02 09:35:37	“↳”	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct? 
2018-08-02 09:36:05	“↳”	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything? 
2018-08-02 09:36:10	“↳”	New territory for us here 
2018-08-02 09:37:50	“↳”	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps 
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA. 
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign. 
2018-08-09 13:46:13	“↳”	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning? 
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete. 
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	“↳”	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints 
2018-08-15 14:47:19	“↳”	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?

2018-08-15 14:53:57	“↳”	the art team in Philly has confused itself about your design specs

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc). 
2018-08-15 15:39:57	“↳”	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though 
2018-08-15 15:40:05	“↳”	but why are they calling ICS? 
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think. 
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too 
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented. 
2018-08-15 15:48:12	“↳”	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 09:45:44	↪	did anyone invite Thomas Hillhouse here yet? 
2018-06-05 11:34:45	↪	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform? 
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff. 
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there 
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches. 
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome 
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes 
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod. 
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo 
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun 
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system. 
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there. 
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though. 
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running. 
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience? 
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired. 
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct? 
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything? 
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here 
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps 
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA. 
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign. 
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning? 
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete. 
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc). 
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though 
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS? 
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think. 
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too 
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented. 
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.

2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 14:53:47	jamestomasino	can you chat on the phone with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:53:57	↪	the art team in Philly has confused itself about your design specs
2018-08-15 14:54:11	↪	I usually provide our team here with this: https://github.com/morsecodemedia/designing-in-a-grid

2018-08-15 14:54:28	↪	but i told her you may have specific specs for any number of reasons and she should check with you direct
2018-08-15 14:54:35	scott.ellison	hmm weird. they seemed good with everything yesterday

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?

2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow.

2018-06-05 11:34:45	↪	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform?
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.

2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.

2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	↪	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints
2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 14:53:57	↪	the art team in Philly has confused itself about your design specs

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	↪	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints
2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow.

2018-04-24 10:55:05	jamestomasino	anyone of you guys have capabilities in working with Umbraco 7 CMS? A new client has a legacy site they want to reskin that's in it.
2018-04-24 10:57:28	scott.ellison	None here
2018-04-24 12:48:52	↪	Anyone off the top of their head remember how the shared resource works in Veeva CLM? its been so long. .I can't remember the syntax and naming conventions.
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 11:34:45	↪	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform?
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.

2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	↪	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints
2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.

2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	↪	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints
2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow.

2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-04-24 12:48:52	↪	Anyone off the top of their head remember how the shared resource works in Veeva CLM? its been so long. .I can't remember the syntax and naming conventions.
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-09-13 13:05:28	jamestomasino	thanks, sir!
2018-09-20 16:13:01	↪	chris.flohr: individuals called out by name. Let's see if that gets movement
2018-09-20 16:13:21	↪	You got the aveed #s? I didn't see it on your list
2018-09-20 16:14:46	↪	@chris.flohr forgot the notification 
2018-09-20 16:15:26	chris.flohr	No, need those as well. sorry!
2018-09-20 16:16:22	↪	2 stage sites and prod
2018-09-20 16:17:34	jamestomasino	Alicia owes you those as well.
2018-09-20 16:19:36	chris.flohr	Sorry to bug you with all that while you're out sick!
2018-09-20 16:24:08	jamestomasino	Needs doing. I wish I didn't need to ask them 4 times
2018-09-24 17:38:59	scott.ellison	Has anyone heard of Veeva Alerts? Not sure if I have just forgotten or its labeled incorrectly.. its a client conversation.
2018-09-24 20:06:11	jamestomasino	yeah
2018-09-24 20:06:23	↪	it's pretty much just a message platform inside CLM
2018-09-25 08:57:31	↪	@chris.flohr: hey chris, would you mind adding "http://tomasino.org (tomasino.org)" to the list of allowed ssh hosts to http://radicava.com (radicava.com)? That's my home ddns (i'm remote today)
2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.
2018-09-25 09:01:10	jamestomasino	96.245.251.162
2018-09-25 09:01:23	↪	we tried the VPN thing after the fix you did last time, but it didn't work
2018-09-25 09:01:39	↪	somehow we must have different vpn ips in newtown than columbus
2018-09-25 09:02:05	chris.flohr	Ah. Next time you connect via VPN, let me know what your IP is and I'll add it to the security group!
2018-09-25 09:02:13	jamestomasino	will do
2018-09-25 09:02:17	chris.flohr	OK, you're all set.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there

2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	↪	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints
2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-04-24 12:48:52	↪	Anyone off the top of their head remember how the shared resource works in Veeva CLM? its been so long. .I can't remember the syntax and naming conventions.
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-09-13 13:05:28	jamestomasino	thanks, sir!
2018-09-20 16:13:01	↪	chris.flohr: individuals called out by name. Let's see if that gets movement
2018-09-20 16:13:21	↪	You got the aveed #s? I didn't see it on your list
2018-09-20 16:14:46	↪	@chris.flohr forgot the notification

2018-09-20 16:24:08	jamestomasino	Needs doing. I wish I didn't need to ask them 4 times
2018-09-24 17:38:59	scott.ellison	Has anyone heard of Veeva Alerts? Not sure if I have just forgotten or its labeled incorrectly.. its a client conversation.
2018-09-24 20:06:11	jamestomasino	yeah
2018-09-24 20:06:23	↪	it's pretty much just a message platform inside CLM
2018-09-25 08:57:31	↪	@chris.flohr: hey chris, would you mind adding "http://tomasino.org (tomasino.org)" to the list of allowed ssh hosts to http://radicava.com (radicava.com)? That's my home ddns (i'm remote today)
2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.
2018-09-25 09:01:10	jamestomasino	96.245.251.162
2018-09-25 09:01:23	↪	we tried the VPN thing after the fix you did last time, but it didn't work
2018-09-25 09:01:39	↪	somehow we must have different vpn ips in newtown than columbus
2018-09-25 09:02:05	chris.flohr	Ah. Next time you connect via VPN, let me know what your IP is and I'll add it to the security group!
2018-09-25 09:02:13	jamestomasino	will do
2018-09-25 09:02:17	chris.flohr	OK, you're all set.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there

2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.

2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 14:53:47	jamestomasino	can you chat on the phone with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:53:57	↪	the art team in Philly has confused itself about your design specs
2018-08-15 14:54:11	↪	I usually provide our team here with this: https://github.com/morsecodemedia/designing-in-a-grid

2018-08-15 14:54:28	↪	but i told her you may have specific specs for any number of reasons and she should check with you direct
2018-08-15 14:54:35	scott.ellison	hmm weird. they seemed good with everything yesterday
2018-08-15 14:55:28	↪	and she usually reaches out as well.. Ill connect for sure.

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-24 20:06:23	↪	it's pretty much just a message platform inside CLM

2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	↪	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints
2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 11:34:45	↪	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform?
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-09-25 08:57:31	↪	@chris.flohr: hey chris, would you mind adding "http://tomasino.org (tomasino.org)" to the list of allowed ssh hosts to http://radicava.com (radicava.com)? That's my home ddns (i'm remote today)
2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.
2018-09-25 09:01:10	jamestomasino	96.245.251.162
2018-09-25 09:01:23	↪	we tried the VPN thing after the fix you did last time, but it didn't work

2018-09-25 09:02:05	chris.flohr	Ah. Next time you connect via VPN, let me know what your IP is and I'll add it to the security group!

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-08-27 14:50:14	jamestomasino	thanks
2018-08-30 09:55:12	↪	@scott.ellison - if you have a moment before you head out for the holiday, please shoot me you Google creds so I can set you up in analytics
2018-08-30 09:55:36	scott.ellison	Certainly
2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-24 17:38:59	scott.ellison	Has anyone heard of Veeva Alerts? Not sure if I have just forgotten or its labeled incorrectly.. its a client conversation.
2018-09-24 20:06:11	jamestomasino	yeah
2018-09-24 20:06:23	↪	it's pretty much just a message platform inside CLM
2018-09-25 08:57:31	↪	@chris.flohr: hey chris, would you mind adding "http://tomasino.org (tomasino.org)" to the list of allowed ssh hosts to http://radicava.com (radicava.com)? That's my home ddns (i'm remote today)
2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.
2018-09-25 09:01:10	jamestomasino	96.245.251.162
2018-09-25 09:01:23	↪	we tried the VPN thing after the fix you did last time, but it didn't work
2018-09-25 09:01:39	↪	somehow we must have different vpn ips in newtown than columbus
2018-09-25 09:02:05	chris.flohr	Ah. Next time you connect via VPN, let me know what your IP is and I'll add it to the security group!
2018-09-25 09:02:13	jamestomasino	will do

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-08-27 14:50:14	jamestomasino	thanks
2018-08-30 09:55:12	↪	@scott.ellison - if you have a moment before you head out for the holiday, please shoot me you Google creds so I can set you up in analytics
2018-08-30 09:55:36	scott.ellison	Certainly
2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-13 13:03:15	chris.flohr	Gotcha. Sent a reply with basic server info.
2018-09-13 13:05:28	jamestomasino	thanks, sir!

2018-09-20 16:24:08	jamestomasino	Needs doing. I wish I didn't need to ask them 4 times
2018-09-24 17:38:59	scott.ellison	Has anyone heard of Veeva Alerts? Not sure if I have just forgotten or its labeled incorrectly.. its a client conversation.
2018-09-24 20:06:11	jamestomasino	yeah
2018-09-24 20:06:23	↪	it's pretty much just a message platform inside CLM
2018-09-25 08:57:31	↪	@chris.flohr: hey chris, would you mind adding "http://tomasino.org (tomasino.org)" to the list of allowed ssh hosts to http://radicava.com (radicava.com)? That's my home ddns (i'm remote today)
2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.
2018-09-25 09:01:10	jamestomasino	96.245.251.162
2018-09-25 09:01:23	↪	we tried the VPN thing after the fix you did last time, but it didn't work
2018-09-25 09:01:39	↪	somehow we must have different vpn ips in newtown than columbus
2018-09-25 09:02:05	chris.flohr	Ah. Next time you connect via VPN, let me know what your IP is and I'll add it to the security group!
2018-09-25 09:02:13	jamestomasino	will do

2018-04-24 10:57:28	scott.ellison	None here
2018-04-24 12:48:52	↪	Anyone off the top of their head remember how the shared resource works in Veeva CLM? its been so long. .I can't remember the syntax and naming conventions.
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 09:45:44	↪	did anyone invite Thomas Hillhouse here yet?
2018-06-05 11:34:45	↪	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform?
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:53:57	↪	the art team in Philly has confused itself about your design specs
2018-08-15 14:54:11	↪	I usually provide our team here with this: https://github.com/morsecodemedia/designing-in-a-grid

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up.

2018-08-15 14:46:49	↪	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.

More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

Hit up Jeremy McDonald if you need something urgently and he can raise me. As soon as my pairing is done, I’ll check my phone for calls.
2018-07-25 19:02:57	jamestomasino	will do! Have fun at the pinball tourney! take pics

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-06-05 11:34:45	↪	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform?
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow.

2018-04-24 10:55:05	jamestomasino	anyone of you guys have capabilities in working with Umbraco 7 CMS? A new client has a legacy site they want to reskin that's in it.
2018-04-24 10:57:28	scott.ellison	None here
2018-04-24 12:48:52	↪	Anyone off the top of their head remember how the shared resource works in Veeva CLM? its been so long. .I can't remember the syntax and naming conventions.
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-09-13 13:03:15	chris.flohr	Gotcha. Sent a reply with basic server info.
2018-09-13 13:05:28	jamestomasino	thanks, sir!
2018-09-20 16:13:01	↪	chris.flohr: individuals called out by name. Let's see if that gets movement
2018-09-20 16:13:21	↪	You got the aveed #s? I didn't see it on your list
2018-09-20 16:14:46	↪	@chris.flohr forgot the notification 
2018-09-20 16:15:26	chris.flohr	No, need those as well. sorry!
2018-09-20 16:16:22	↪	2 stage sites and prod
2018-09-20 16:17:34	jamestomasino	Alicia owes you those as well.

2018-09-20 16:24:08	jamestomasino	Needs doing. I wish I didn't need to ask them 4 times
2018-09-24 17:38:59	scott.ellison	Has anyone heard of Veeva Alerts? Not sure if I have just forgotten or its labeled incorrectly.. its a client conversation.
2018-09-24 20:06:11	jamestomasino	yeah
2018-09-24 20:06:23	↪	it's pretty much just a message platform inside CLM
2018-09-25 08:57:31	↪	@chris.flohr: hey chris, would you mind adding "http://tomasino.org (tomasino.org)" to the list of allowed ssh hosts to http://radicava.com (radicava.com)? That's my home ddns (i'm remote today)
2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.
2018-09-25 09:01:10	jamestomasino	96.245.251.162
2018-09-25 09:01:23	↪	we tried the VPN thing after the fix you did last time, but it didn't work
2018-09-25 09:01:39	↪	somehow we must have different vpn ips in newtown than columbus
2018-09-25 09:02:05	chris.flohr	Ah. Next time you connect via VPN, let me know what your IP is and I'll add it to the security group!
2018-09-25 09:02:13	jamestomasino	will do
2018-09-25 09:02:17	chris.flohr	OK, you're all set.

2018-04-24 10:57:28	scott.ellison	None here
2018-04-24 12:48:52	↪	Anyone off the top of their head remember how the shared resource works in Veeva CLM? its been so long. .I can't remember the syntax and naming conventions.
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?

2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.

2018-10-24 10:02:38		getting channel history...
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-08-27 14:46:55	jamestomasino	@chris.flohr: can you install php5-curl on 54.89.23.100 and restart apache?

2018-08-27 14:48:06	chris.flohr	No worries! Just avoiding one hell of a headache. :wink:
2018-08-27 14:49:16	↪	Done!
2018-08-27 14:50:14	jamestomasino	thanks
2018-08-30 09:55:12	↪	@scott.ellison - if you have a moment before you head out for the holiday, please shoot me you Google creds so I can set you up in analytics
2018-08-30 09:55:36	scott.ellison	Certainly
2018-08-30 09:58:16	chris.flohr	Got OSX 10.13 running in a VM. Performance is still a little sloppy and not worthy of doing your daily work on it, but this may be worthwhile for QC and testing on specific versions of the OS and Safari.
2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-13 12:56:55	jamestomasino	@chris.flohr - http://radicava.ca (radicava.ca) site I had you spin up a while back is being managed by GSW Canada. CC'd you on an email about access & config. Scott's out so his team needs more info.
2018-09-13 13:03:15	chris.flohr	Gotcha. Sent a reply with basic server info.
2018-09-13 13:05:28	jamestomasino	thanks, sir!
2018-09-20 16:13:01	↪	chris.flohr: individuals called out by name. Let's see if that gets movement
2018-09-20 16:13:21	↪	You got the aveed #s? I didn't see it on your list
2018-09-20 16:14:46	↪	@chris.flohr forgot the notification 
2018-09-20 16:15:26	chris.flohr	No, need those as well. sorry!
2018-09-20 16:16:22	↪	2 stage sites and prod
2018-09-20 16:17:34	jamestomasino	Alicia owes you those as well.
2018-09-20 16:19:36	chris.flohr	Sorry to bug you with all that while you're out sick!
2018-09-20 16:24:08	jamestomasino	Needs doing. I wish I didn't need to ask them 4 times
2018-09-24 17:38:59	scott.ellison	Has anyone heard of Veeva Alerts? Not sure if I have just forgotten or its labeled incorrectly.. its a client conversation.
2018-09-24 20:06:11	jamestomasino	yeah
2018-09-24 20:06:23	↪	it's pretty much just a message platform inside CLM
2018-09-25 08:57:31	↪	@chris.flohr: hey chris, would you mind adding "http://tomasino.org (tomasino.org)" to the list of allowed ssh hosts to http://radicava.com (radicava.com)? That's my home ddns (i'm remote today)
2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.
2018-09-25 09:01:10	jamestomasino	96.245.251.162
2018-09-25 09:01:23	↪	we tried the VPN thing after the fix you did last time, but it didn't work
2018-09-25 09:01:39	↪	somehow we must have different vpn ips in newtown than columbus
2018-09-25 09:02:05	chris.flohr	Ah. Next time you connect via VPN, let me know what your IP is and I'll add it to the security group!
2018-09-25 09:02:13	jamestomasino	will do
2018-09-25 09:02:17	chris.flohr	OK, you're all set.
2018-09-25 09:02:25	jamestomasino	thanks!

2018-11-01 17:57:15	chris.flohr	What site? Sorry, no where near a computer
2018-10-24 10:02:38		getting channel history...
2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!
2018-06-01 10:38:05		**Please add to thread with ideas to keep them all in one place
2018-06-05 09:43:18	jamestomasino	ahh, there we go
2018-06-05 09:43:25	↪	wee-slack plugin
2018-06-05 09:45:44	↪	did anyone invite Thomas Hillhouse here yet?
2018-06-05 11:34:45	↪	chris.flohr: have you checked out terraform?
2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out
2018-06-15 09:49:14	↪	hey all
2018-06-15 09:49:27	scott.ellison	gm
2018-06-15 09:49:30	jamestomasino	don't think I can make the call today. I got clobbered with client calls
2018-06-15 09:49:54	↪	I do need to follow up with you all, though. I'm losing one of my Sr. devs soon and we're probably gonna need a hand
2018-06-15 09:51:10	scott.ellison	We are ready willing and able up here in Canada! :slightly_smiling_face: Its cost effective too! :slightly_smiling_face:
2018-06-15 21:09:35	jamestomasino	:D I'll be in touch
2018-06-27 10:08:02	↪	Hey, is anyone lurking?
2018-06-27 10:15:37	scott.ellison	Using Siri to respond
2018-06-27 10:15:45	↪	I’m lurking in my car travelling

2018-06-27 15:38:26	↪	I was trying to get someone to send an invite to Thomas Hillhouse, the new Navicor TD in Philly since I couldn't get it to work
2018-07-02 11:18:58	↪	scott.ellison: Aveed stuff headed your way
2018-07-02 12:02:54	scott.ellison	Awesome. Full disclosure. Today is a Canadian holiday, July 1st Canada Day. Like your July 4th thing. Quite enjoying a beer on a pub patio at the moment. Hehe :)

2018-07-05 09:30:24	jamestomasino	hey jason, can you re-send me the virtual meeting invite? I had deleted it when we didn't have the hardware

2018-07-05 10:04:58	jamestomasino	got a code yet?

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	↪	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints
2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-09-25 09:00:46	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino I can only list IP addresses or CIDRs, so DDNS won't work. It's pretty easy for me to swap IPs around, so if your DDNS IP doesn't change often, I can use that or just use your home IP.
2018-09-25 09:00:57	↪	Alternative, you should be able to VPN in and get access.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).
2018-06-01 10:38:05		If you can think of or have any small demo scenarios you'd like to see augmented for client brainstorms / demos. Let me know!

2018-06-05 12:00:25	chris.flohr	Yup! I’ve been playing with it for a bit now. Really cool stuff.
2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there
2018-06-05 12:02:11	↪	And if I’m being honest, I’m not feeling too great about using a kubernetes pod for production servers JUST yet, but it should be fine for staging/dev branches.
2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:46:49	↪	for the navicor work you guys are doing, it sounds like your design team is very confused about the sizes of your breakpoints
2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though

2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-05 12:01:27	↪	I’ve been playing with kubernetes along with terraform to deploy pods on demand. Totally not ready for prime time yet, but I’m getting there

2018-06-06 10:22:06	jamestomasino	that's awesome
2018-06-06 10:22:13	↪	i need to learn more about kubernetes
2018-06-06 10:28:33	chris.flohr	A friend of mine has been doing a lot of work with Kubernetes and Google Cloud Platform. For funzies, he got an NES emulator running in a cluster, and emulated every US-released NES game at the same time in the pod.
2018-06-06 10:35:47	jamestomasino	NES! woo
2018-06-06 10:41:43	↪	I'm emulating all the nintendo systems up through Wii on my comp at home, but a container deployment would be even more fun
2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.
2018-06-06 10:45:43	↪	Good learning opportunity though.
2018-06-06 10:46:50	↪	If you've not tried LaunchBox, it's worth a peek. It's not Hyperspin, but it also doesn't need Flash or crazy amounts of config in 20 million XML files to get it running.
2018-06-06 10:50:39	jamestomasino	i'll check it out

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-06-01 10:38:05	jason	So, as I wait impatiently for this kido to arrive... I'm getting my development kit back up and running for AR development. More likely on the ARcore / ARkit side of the world. Probably some sort of current capabilities selection of sorts. A few small demo scenes with similar branding / objects / trackers (if needed). Hoping to also build one Unity project for iOS and Android that combines / utilizes Arkit and ARcore (possibly some Vuforia) (possibly wearable AR like Hololens).

2018-06-06 10:44:48	chris.flohr	Nice! I'm doing the same. I've been using LaunchBox as my frontend with MAME and RetroArch as backends. Also made a nice little powershell script to export the favorites from each system in LaunchBox. It spits out scraped art and info, along with the ROM, to the correctly named folder for use with RetroPie. In this way, you can curate your games on the PC and then dump the good ones to a Pi without having to rescrape or re-curate your rom directory per-system.
2018-06-06 10:45:33	↪	I've been trying to port the powershell script over to WPF, but I'm still fighting the learning curve there.

Hit up Jeremy McDonald if you need something urgently and he can raise me. As soon as my pairing is done, I’ll check my phone for calls.
2018-07-25 19:02:57	jamestomasino	will do! Have fun at the pinball tourney! take pics

2018-08-02 09:34:36	jamestomasino	hey everyone, i've got a tricky situation with ios provisioning profiles. Anyone around with experience?
2018-08-02 09:35:12	↪	Our provisioning profile for a private enterprise app for Endo expired on the 31st. We didn't create it. Endo did and passed it to us. Looks like the app has stopped working since it expired.
2018-08-02 09:35:37	↪	I'm thinking we need to have them renew the cert or issue a new one, send it our way, and rebuild the app and push out an update. Is that correct?
2018-08-02 09:36:05	↪	if they renew the provisioning profile, do we still need to rebuild and update for all users, or is that verified off a key server externally and we don't need to do anything?
2018-08-02 09:36:10	↪	New territory for us here
2018-08-02 09:37:50	↪	it seems like renewing the cert alone might be enough for app store deployments, but I can't find a clear answer on enterprise apps
2018-08-02 09:42:51	chris.flohr	As I understand it, you need to resign the app and redeploy. The cert for enterprise apps are held within the IPA.
2018-08-02 15:18:22	jamestomasino	thanks chris. It looks like they're going to try renewing the provisioning profile cert in Airwatch and see if that does the trick. Failing that we'll take the new cert and resign.
2018-08-09 13:46:13	↪	chris.flohr: hey, do you have any boilerplate language you use in RFPs around our process for monitoring sites for security and versioning?
2018-08-09 13:50:40	chris.flohr	I'm usually not tapped for RFPs (thank gods), but we have a daemon running on any Linux box that DevOps sets up that automatically installs updates that are tagged with security updates. We keep all other packages as they are unless there's a good reason to update - mostly because we don't want to break anything that's currently in-flight and a major version update could really mess things up. We also keep tabs on the major packages we install for critical updates and work with the groups involved to make sure their code still works as intended after the update is complete.
2018-08-09 14:27:51	jamestomasino	cool, thanks

2018-08-15 14:47:19	↪	they hit up our ICS team here and they came to me and now they're all confused. Can you give them a call and clear it up directly with Emily Mengel?
2018-08-15 14:52:37	chris.flohr	@jamestomasino If you put the at sign before someone’s name, you can tag them and they’ll get a notification, unless they’ve disabled the feature. At least for me, it’s the best way to get my attention if you need me.

2018-08-15 15:39:30	thomas.hillhouse	@scott.ellison  if this is the loxo landing page, You had suggested three breakpoints - phone, ipad/desktop, really big desktop.  For $$ reasons they opted to do the first two and make the third one a simple extension of the 2nd (specify how do the margins grow, etc).
2018-08-15 15:39:57	↪	it wouldn't surprise me if they got confused in the past 24 hours though
2018-08-15 15:40:05	↪	but why are they calling ICS?
2018-08-15 15:40:52	scott.ellison	ya.. no idea.. I have just sent through what is hopefully a clarifying email. Let me know what you think.
2018-08-15 15:47:23	thomas.hillhouse	looks like retina got them confused. it confuses me too
2018-08-15 15:47:47	scott.ellison	confuses a lot of people.. I think part of that is how its implemented.
2018-08-15 15:48:12	↪	even thought the res is doubled you still define it as the non retina.. as in things like 1024 etc.

2018-08-30 09:58:16		Note that the hardware this is running on is an i7-8700K, watercooled processor overclocked by 35%, a founders edition 1070, and 8GB of RAM associated to the VM… and it’s still slow. I figure it’s a configuration thing. If anyone has done OSX in VMs or a Hackintosh before and had similar experiences with performance, let me know.
