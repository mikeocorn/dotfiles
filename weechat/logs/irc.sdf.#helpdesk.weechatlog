2018-09-12 13:05:40	peteyboy	what is ssh://sdf.org?
2018-09-12 13:05:45	peteyboy	you mean https://sdf.org?
2018-09-12 13:07:04	peteyboy	or ssh darwin@sdf.org?
2018-09-12 13:22:41	njsg	I'd guess that means accessing sdf.org over the ssh protocol
2018-09-12 13:37:11	peteyboy	well that is working for me
2018-09-12 13:37:43	peteyboy	is that like a putty-ish
2018-09-12 13:37:46	peteyboy	putty-ism
2018-09-12 13:38:00	njsg	no, that's an URLism
2018-09-12 13:38:29	peteyboy	is it?
2018-09-12 13:38:34	njsg	that's how URLs are supposed to be used
2018-09-12 13:38:45	peteyboy	my browser doesn't know how to respond to ssh:// protocol
2018-09-12 13:38:49	njsg	I have no idea if there are specific rules for ssh, or a specific URL specification for ssh
2018-09-12 13:39:03	njsg	That's a problem with your browser or your OS, and that is if you decide it is a problem
2018-09-12 13:39:14	njsg	But it is, nevertheless, how URLs are supposed to work
2018-09-12 13:39:19	peteyboy	it asks for a helper app, which is why I ask if it's a putty-ism that putty steps in and understands that
2018-09-12 13:39:37	peteyboy	ssh requires a user anyway
2018-09-12 13:39:49	njsg	Does it?
2018-09-12 13:39:54	peteyboy	indeed
2018-09-12 13:40:04	njsg	At least on many systems, it will use your username if you do not provide one.
2018-09-12 13:40:13	njsg	well, on many systems I've used
2018-09-12 13:40:34	njsg	I just don't know about Windows
2018-09-12 13:41:00	njsg	Ah, IIRC putty will ask you for the username if you do not specify one

2018-09-12 13:41:25	njsg	in all UNIX systems I've used so far, ssh uses the current user name.
2018-09-12 13:41:32	njsg	but I can't say I've used a lot of UNIX systems.
2018-09-12 13:41:43	njsg	well, s.UNIX.&/&-like.
2018-09-12 13:42:03	peteyboy	well, yes, that's still requiring a user name
2018-09-12 13:42:22	njsg	But then, how would ssh://host be a problem?
2018-09-12 13:42:28	njsg	Which was the question
2018-09-12 13:42:46	peteyboy	you can't blindly give out an address like that expecting the user to have it work?
2018-09-12 13:42:50	peteyboy	that would be the problem
2018-09-12 13:43:04	peteyboy	i mean, the person you give it to <- user
2018-09-12 13:44:08	peteyboy	it's not really a Universal RL if it doesn't work when you point to it, no?
2018-09-12 13:44:13	peteyboy	but I mean, I guess
2018-09-12 13:44:19	peteyboy	i'm just being pedantic at this point

2018-09-12 14:19:22	@rcf	peteyboy: being pedantic as well, the location of the resource does not change regardless of authentication, so leaving out the user name makes it more univsersal in this case.
2018-09-12 14:20:09	peteyboy	hmm ok
2018-09-12 14:20:14	@rcf	It would only be truly required if interactive authentication were not possible. 
2018-09-12 14:21:01	peteyboy	so does putty or another tool use ssh://host?
2018-09-12 14:21:07	peteyboy	i've not seen it
2018-09-12 14:21:44	peteyboy	like in the smj note in the topic, it just talks about "ssh to tty.sdf.org"
2018-09-12 14:22:16	@rcf	git is one of the more prominent users of the ssh:// URL scheme.
2018-09-12 14:22:22	peteyboy	(rather, "use tty.sdf.org to ssh to SDF"
2018-09-12 14:22:23	peteyboy	)
2018-09-12 14:22:57	peteyboy	oh, right that is true
2018-09-12 14:23:59	@rcf	User is often included in that just because hosting services are locked down in most cases but on my SDF repos it is not strictly required.
2018-09-12 14:25:58	njsg	peteyboy: honestly, a lot of ssh clients have the ability to define the username for a given host. So the most portable way would be to specify no username at all
2018-09-12 14:26:09	njsg	How else do you suggest an URL is made that works for everybody?
2018-09-12 14:26:17	njsg	It surely won't be by using a fixed username in the URL.
2018-09-12 14:26:30	njsg	just like you can make IRC links without specifying any nickname
2018-09-12 14:26:52	peteyboy	i guess I am suggesting that ssh:// isn't a valid URL, but I suppose if git is using it.
2018-09-12 14:27:14	njsg	Although IRC URLs are a bit of a mess because some software and some people will omit "#", which works with some servers that only use "#" as a channel prefix, but complicates things elsewhere
2018-09-12 14:27:28	njsg	Why would ssh:// not be a valid URL?
2018-09-12 14:27:53	njsg	And, worst case, it could even be that almost nothing would handle ssh, it would still be useful as a way to write it down
2018-09-12 14:28:04	njsg	Humans could simply read it and see "protocol is ssh, host is xyz"
2018-09-12 14:28:25	peteyboy	humans reading it is another thing
2018-09-12 14:28:28	@rcf	peteyboy: browsers can also be configured to make use of it. I haven’t don’t that in a while, though. My elinks config still has it, I think.

2018-09-12 14:28:53	peteyboy	well, if you guys say so
2018-09-12 14:28:58	peteyboy	i've just never seen it like that
2018-09-12 14:29:11	njsg	Only because your system isn't configured to handle ssh:// doesn't mean it is wrong.
2018-09-12 14:29:27	peteyboy	i've not seen it configured on any system that way is what I'm saying
2018-09-12 14:29:33	peteyboy	i've not seen anyone refrence it that way
2018-09-12 14:29:39	njsg	There is a first time for everything. Some people have never heard of USENET being used for text posts, some people have never heard of USENET being used for sharing large binaries.
2018-09-12 14:29:42	peteyboy	even my git doesn't do it
2018-09-12 14:31:02	njsg	That's how URLs are, tomorrow I could see a protocol I had never seen before used in an address. That's just it, you can make it for a lot of protocols.

2018-09-12 14:35:02	peteyboy	all right, I yield due to git's use of it.
2018-09-12 14:38:17	@demure	ssh:// is a uri convention, it works, but not all OS's, browsers, etc know all URI formats
2018-09-12 14:39:16	@demure	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier
2018-09-12 14:39:58	@demure	<peteyboy> i guess I am suggesting that ssh:// isn't a valid URL, but I suppose if git is using it. 
2018-09-12 14:40:19	@demure	it _is_ valid, whether or not you are able to get it working for yourself 
2018-09-12 14:41:17	peteyboy	sheesh, I already yielded! :)
2018-09-12 14:42:20	peteyboy	still saying "ssh://sdf.org doesn't work for me", which is what started this, seems like an indeterminate question
2018-09-12 14:42:28	peteyboy	i don't think that works for most people
2018-09-12 14:42:36	peteyboy	if anyone
2018-09-12 14:43:25	peteyboy	even if there's been a git repo set up, it's not at "ssh://sdf.org"
2018-09-12 14:43:49	peteyboy	and I was saying that 'ssh user@sdf.org' works for me

2018-09-14 12:01:44	Hercules	I see
2018-09-14 12:02:37	@demure	I recommend looking at the options available from linode and digitalocean

2018-09-20 09:14:21	@rcf	adamd: I would guess it is an issue caused by the move from RC1 to stable (because it does still work on iceland, which is still RC1) 
2018-09-20 09:14:48	@rcf	Whoever upgraded the system has yet to upgrade all the packages, basically. 
2018-09-20 09:15:32	@rcf	Running `ldd` there are other missing libraries as well.

2018-09-20 09:22:11	@rcf	adamd: somebody's already made a thread in requests on bboard (which I've replied to as well), so hopefully this shall be resolved shortly.

2018-09-20 18:23:40	%koenig	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  1187 Aug  2  2016 /usr/pkg/bin/hg
2018-09-20 18:23:48	%koenig	So the difference is in the permission bits.
2018-09-20 18:24:50	%koenig	On git, the -rwxr-x--- means that "owner" (root) has (r)ead, (w)rite, e(x)ecute, "group" (users) has (r)ead and e(x)ecute, and "world" has no privileges.
2018-09-20 18:25:04	%koenig	On hg, the "world" permissions are read and execute.
2018-09-20 18:25:33	dzho	yeah I was just getting to that after nosing around some more
2018-09-20 18:25:36		tomasino has left #helpdesk (Peace)
2018-09-20 18:25:36	%koenig	The quirky thing about Unix is that if you happen to be in the group (in this case, wheel) and the permissions are set to disallow you, it doesn't matter if world is open to allow it.
2018-09-20 18:25:57	%koenig	SDF actually uses that quirk to some use in some places.

2018-09-24 14:41:04	@odie	hi
2018-09-24 14:41:42	@odie	does anyone know how to change ones full name on the cluster e.g. for bboard?
2018-09-24 14:42:05	@odie	i know this has been discussed on bboard in the last time
2018-09-24 14:42:13	@odie	but i cant find it
2018-09-24 14:42:19	@odie	also not on the faq
2018-09-24 14:42:24	@odie	(i hope)
2018-09-24 14:42:24	@demure	there was a way added to `maint` I believe
2018-09-24 14:42:28	@odie	i tried maint
2018-09-24 14:42:48	@odie	but this seems to only affect external finger informations
2018-09-24 14:44:04	@demure	how long ago did you edit it?
2018-09-24 14:44:52	@demure	looks like the bboard archives are borked....
2018-09-24 14:45:18	%koenig	If it's not `maint` then it may be in `chfn`.
2018-09-24 14:45:26	@odie	some tome yesterday
2018-09-24 14:45:30	@demure	chfn -> maint
2018-09-24 14:45:30	@odie	maybe 22h?
2018-09-24 14:45:45	@demure	I know there was a way added in the last two years...
2018-09-24 14:45:47	@demure	and that I used it
2018-09-24 14:46:28	%koenig	huh.  So it is.  I did not know that.
2018-09-24 14:46:40	@demure	and that old posts were not updated, only new posts

2018-09-26 07:30:40	+spreval	So when I open this terminal, it asks me for a host name, i type delme, then I enter my username
2018-09-26 07:30:49	+spreval	It then says it cannot resolve delme
2018-09-26 07:31:12	%koenig	No, you need to type one of the hostnames and log into your account called "spreval".

2018-09-26 07:36:32	%koenig	So I can tell you this: your account is an unvalidated account and therefore will eventually get purged on its own.
2018-09-26 07:36:44	%koenig	That may take a year or, I believe, possibly 666 days.
2018-09-26 07:37:05	%koenig	If you are concerned about it sticking around needlessly, that's probably okay.
2018-09-26 07:37:22	+spreval	Ok, so just leave it to fester for a while? I did read it takes 200 days if I don't log in.
2018-09-26 07:37:34	%koenig	Yeah, it could be 200 days too.  I don't quite know.
2018-09-26 07:37:49	%koenig	I suspect that since your account is unvalidated it cannot run the `delme` command.
2018-09-26 07:38:05	+spreval	Ok, I'll just leave it to stew then. Thank you for your help. Have a lovely day :)
2018-09-26 07:38:11	%koenig	Best of luck to you.

2018-09-29 07:14:20	@mordak	i have been an arpa member for 15 years but just switched to Meta
2018-09-29 07:15:01	@mordak	I have set secret with mkvpm

2018-09-29 07:18:00	@mordak	yes i spent most of yesterday trying every conceivable combination I could
2018-09-29 07:18:24	@mordak	i am thinking it is a username issue.
2018-09-29 07:18:43	▬▬▶	LadyPomegranate has joined #helpdesk
2018-09-29 07:18:50	@mordak	I use mordak@freeshell.org and have since I joined in 2003
2018-09-29 07:19:27	@fmoonII	I know demure is using K9, he might be able to help. although he's also forwarding mail to MA so dunno if that also requires different config
2018-09-29 07:19:54	@mordak	The weird thing is webmail and pine email through the command line shiw different emails.
2018-09-29 07:20:12	@mordak	pine sees email that the webmail does not see anymore
2018-09-29 07:20:28	@fmoonII	they likely access different folders, look at the filesystem from the shell
2018-09-29 07:20:59	@mordak	yes i think pine uses mbox and webmail imap folders
2018-09-29 07:22:34	@mordak	I am considering renaming all my current folder with a ~ before and letting the mail repopulate anew
2018-09-29 07:23:59	@fmoonII	tutorial says, for K9 only put the username, not the domainname https://sdf.org/?tutorials/smtpauth
2018-09-29 07:24:59	@mordak	I will check again. I see conflicting tutorials from command line and web
2018-09-29 07:25:44	@demure	I think smtp got fucked up/secretly changed recently. I haven't cared enough to post on the bboard to input.
2018-09-29 07:26:06	@mordak	okay
2018-09-29 07:26:36	@mordak	it is not a huge deal more of a convenience thing for me.I do not care for webmail
2018-09-29 07:27:01	@mordak	too little control over settings.
2018-09-29 07:27:20	@fmoonII	now you are mixing 2 things. dmure is talking about smtp auth
2018-09-29 07:29:20	@mordak	agreed I am merely saying I want to use smtp with K9 so I don't have to use webmail anymore
2018-09-29 07:29:32	@fmoonII	oh, gotcha, my bad
2018-09-29 07:29:46	@mordak	no problem
2018-09-29 07:31:10	@mordak	I have never used sdf.org with my username for email or webspace but I have tried many combinations including my mordak.freeshell.org
2018-09-29 07:31:35	@mordak	nothing works. but thr incoming server sets up no problem.
2018-09-29 07:31:44	@fmoonII	it might be the way to go with K9, but not other clients
2018-09-29 07:32:40	@mordak	for incoming imap, i just use mordak for the user name and it works. no so with smtp so weird
2018-09-29 07:35:23	@fmoonII	maybe try a different client, e.g. thunderbird on computer, to verify if it's a server problem
2018-09-29 07:35:41	@fmoonII	and if that doesn't work, then I think a bboard post is in order
2018-09-29 07:35:43	@mordak	okay good idea
2018-09-29 07:36:19	@mordak	cool thanks.gotta go make breakfast thanks for the help everyone.

2018-10-03 05:11:27	@mlaine	however if your account is that recent, the issue must be elsewhere
2018-10-03 05:12:16	tmv	that command, it delets the account?
2018-10-03 05:12:38	@mlaine	erm, what?
2018-10-03 05:12:48	tmv	sorry, it was bot haha right?
2018-10-03 05:12:56	@mlaine	yes
2018-10-03 05:12:56	tmv	my error
2018-10-03 05:13:30	tmv	Wouldn't be better if I just create another one?
2018-10-03 05:13:46	@mlaine	if that suits you, just go for it
2018-10-03 05:14:10	tmv	ok, maybe then tmv could expire...
2018-10-03 05:14:13	tmv	thanks
2018-10-03 05:14:22	@mlaine	otherwise you must contact the admins
2018-10-03 05:14:34	tmv	How can I do that?
2018-10-03 05:15:01	@mlaine	bboard is the preferred way, but you need to get on to the system first
2018-10-03 05:15:17	@mlaine	email to membership@sdf.org should work, although it may take some time
2018-10-03 05:15:38	@mlaine	just getting a new account is the easiest and fastest way
2018-10-03 05:15:53	tmv	ok, thanks a lot, let me just create another one to see if is related to the old one
2018-10-03 05:16:30	@mlaine	good luck
2018-10-03 05:19:14	tmv	it worked
2018-10-03 05:19:25	tmv	I think it had something to do with validation
2018-10-03 05:19:35	tmv	thanks for everything, good day/night :)
2018-10-03 05:20:07	@mlaine	see you

2018-10-03 21:44:13	jerrod	anyone ssh to arpa with pub/priv keys from macos?  I've followed the directions from the FAQ but no luck yet.
2018-10-03 21:44:21	jerrod	been tinkering with it for a couple hours
2018-10-03 21:44:57	jerrod	figure I'm missing something small
2018-10-03 21:45:06	@benharri	i do from linux but it should be the same
2018-10-03 21:45:26	@benharri	have you tried -vvv
2018-10-03 21:45:54	@demure	^ yes, what errors?
2018-10-03 21:49:13	jerrod	yeah, nothing jumps out at me from -vvv but this line "we did not send a packet, disable method"
2018-10-03 21:52:23	jerrod	or maybe "debug3: start over, passed a different list publickey,password,keyboard-interactive,hostbased"
2018-10-03 21:52:43	jerrod	something happens then it defaults to password again
2018-10-03 21:52:47	@benharri	is it permission denied (pubkey)
2018-10-03 21:53:04	@benharri	are you specifying the right key?
2018-10-03 21:54:22	jerrod	no nothing says denied
2018-10-03 21:55:03	jerrod	i think so.  I currently only have one id_rsa in .ssh, and i'm explicitely calling it out with "ssh -i id_rsa"
2018-10-03 21:58:42	jerrod	looks like it might be a server side thing, judging by googling this error "receive packet: type 51"
2018-10-03 22:04:41	jerrod	ha not sure what I goofed up.  instead of manually creating authorized_keys I used ssh_copy_id and works now

2018-10-03 22:24:52	@benharri	ssh-copy-id is handy
2018-10-03 22:25:14	@benharri	generally i do echo "ssh-rsa and so on" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
2018-10-03 22:27:03	@demure	can you paste the output of the -vvv into a pastebin/etc?
2018-10-03 22:27:22	@demure	ah, nvm
2018-10-03 22:28:00	jerrod	yeah working now, thanks.  i had essentially the same error as this guy https://superuser.com/questions/1137438/ssh-key-authentication-fails
2018-10-03 22:29:07	jerrod	it seems to break when i " chmod -R 600 $HOME/.ssh" per the FAQ instructions
2018-10-03 22:34:11	@demure	<_<
2018-10-03 22:34:48	@demure	I have 700 on ~/.ssh
2018-10-03 22:36:01	@benharri	yeah for the dir
2018-10-03 22:36:07	@benharri	600 on the files in it
2018-10-03 22:41:06	jerrod	yeah that's what i have now too.  was only following the FAQ.  https://sdf.org/?faq?HACKER?07
2018-10-03 22:47:33	@demure	benharri: do you see any reason I shouldn't replace the '6' in that file with a '7'? (like, should I be more verbose)
2018-10-03 22:47:54	@demure	hmmm, wait...
2018-10-03 22:48:01	@benharri	could be chmod 700 ~/.ssh then chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
2018-10-03 22:48:09	@demure	the cli version of that file is right (700)
2018-10-03 22:48:23	@demure	it's also under 'TECHIES'
2018-10-03 22:55:52	@demure	welp, made a bboard post asking for the FAQ dirs to be fixed

2018-10-04 01:47:10	leosemilie	what is happening there is that you are trusting the server is a secure multiuser design
2018-10-04 01:47:23	leosemilie	the key is best used with 400
2018-10-04 01:47:42	leosemilie	600 means writeable
2018-10-04 01:48:02	leosemilie	a key never needs to be writable
2018-10-04 01:48:36	@demure	You want your ~/.ssh to be writeable.
2018-10-04 01:49:15	@benharri	ah that's right 
2018-10-04 01:49:19	@benharri	keys should be 400
2018-10-04 01:49:19	@demure	I could see arguments for subnfiles being -w for the user... But I don't see it as manditory *shurg*
2018-10-04 01:49:27	@benharri	config and authorized_keys etc can be 600
2018-10-04 01:58:02	leosemilie	it is simpler than it seems

2018-10-10 15:48:39	@demure	hi
2018-10-10 15:49:59	bradfonseca	Sorry, I'm trying to figure out IRC on SDF
2018-10-10 15:50:14	bradfonseca	I think I'm here by accident
2018-10-10 15:50:43	@demure	the ircd is set to autojoin users to #helpdesk
2018-10-10 15:50:55	bradfonseca	Ah
2018-10-10 15:54:48	bradfonseca	I actually do have a question about my custom URL http://bradfonseca.paunix.org
2018-10-10 15:55:19	bradfonseca	When I attempt to reach my index page I get redirected to sdf.org
2018-10-10 15:55:39	@demure	how long ago did you set up your page?
2018-10-10 15:55:40	bradfonseca	However, https://sdf.org/~bradfonseca/ works
2018-10-10 15:55:49	bradfonseca	Over a week ago
2018-10-10 15:55:59	@demure	how long have you been seeing this issue?
2018-10-10 15:56:07	bradfonseca	Since the beginning
2018-10-10 15:56:20	@demure	then I would suggest posting on the bboard about it
2018-10-10 15:56:21	bradfonseca	I think I might have a setting wrong?
2018-10-10 15:56:23	@demure	!faq bboard
2018-10-10 15:56:23	&BASHy2-EU	Anything that requires an Admin should go to the bboard.
2018-10-10 15:56:24	&BASHy2-EU	If you are reading this, your issue will be better handled on the bboard.
2018-10-10 15:56:24	&BASHy2-EU	To run bboard, use the command 'bboard' in the shell. See the man page for help.

2018-10-10 23:12:54	karen	hi. I just joined and it seems I have to validate my account to get more features, but I couldn't find instructions for that. I did find a 3rd party website that said I have to send in $1 to a po box. is that legit? 
2018-10-10 23:13:16	zcrayfish	That's how I validated years and years ago

2018-10-10 23:19:00	karen	do you think it would be acceptable for my home computer to sftp into their server once every 30 seconds continuously just uploading a small jpg for a public webcam?
2018-10-10 23:20:32	karen	i wouldn't want to violate any rules in that way
2018-10-10 23:21:09	zcrayfish	I am not sure, I don't access SDF by automated means... Hopefully someone who knows will pop up soon

2018-10-12 11:16:18	nuck	hi evreryboddy
2018-10-12 11:16:39	nuck	i'm doing it right?
2018-10-12 11:16:56	nuck	can someboddy read me?
2018-10-12 11:17:01	%koenig	Hello nuck!  Yes, I think you're doing it right.
2018-10-12 11:17:05	%koenig	Welcome to SDF IRC.
2018-10-12 11:17:14	nuck	Ok.
2018-10-12 11:17:18	nuck	Thanks
2018-10-12 11:17:43	nuck	Hey, i have a question about ARPA 
2018-10-12 11:17:52	%koenig	Ok, I'll try to answer.
2018-10-12 11:18:07	nuck	i want to be one ARPA user
2018-10-12 11:18:50	nuck	What i need to do to get it?
2018-10-12 11:19:30	nuck	please
2018-10-12 11:19:43	%koenig	You make a $36 one-time donation, specifying your SDF username with the payment.
2018-10-12 11:19:52	%koenig	Hang on a second and I'll dig up the link that explains what to do.
2018-10-12 11:20:19	%koenig	https://sdf.org/?join
2018-10-12 11:20:43	%koenig	So for ARPA membership,  you can see that under the second section on that page.
2018-10-12 11:21:02	%koenig	At the bottom of the page are instructions on where to send donations for membership.
2018-10-12 11:21:15	%koenig	The MOST IMPORTANT thing is to make sure you write your SDF username on the donation.
2018-10-12 11:21:33	%koenig	(Or specify it with the PayPal donation if you go that route.)
2018-10-12 11:21:54	%koenig	The biggest thing that snags people is that they don't include their username, so the admins don't know which account to apply the donation to.
2018-10-12 11:22:10	nuck	The 'Make a Donation' button is good for me
2018-10-12 11:22:20	%koenig	That should work.
2018-10-12 11:23:00	nuck	Ok, so my nick name in the description field 
2018-10-12 11:23:04	nuck	right?
2018-10-12 11:23:26	%koenig	I believe that's the right thing to do.  I joined ARPA in 2005 and sent a paper check, so it was different for me.
2018-10-12 11:23:48	nuck	and a $36 in price for item field
2018-10-12 11:23:56	nuck	Haha
2018-10-12 11:24:00	nuck	Ok. good
2018-10-12 11:24:16	%koenig	Welcome aboard.  :)
2018-10-12 11:24:22	nuck	Thanks!
2018-10-12 11:24:24	%koenig	SDF is a fun place.
2018-10-12 11:24:33	%koenig	Have you been to the #sdf channel on irc.sdf.org?
2018-10-12 11:24:38	%koenig	People hang out there and chat a lot.
2018-10-12 11:24:50	nuck	Yes it is. I'll be a good place for me
2018-10-12 11:24:57	%koenig	Have you tried aNONradio (http://anonradio.net)?  There are a lot of great shows on there.
2018-10-12 11:25:11	nuck	Yes, very nice station
2018-10-12 11:25:35	%koenig	Always glad to meet new interesting people.  Feel free to ping me if you have questions while you look around.  I'm often online, but occasionally sleep.  :)
2018-10-12 11:25:42	%koenig	Many people will be willing to help you, though.
2018-10-12 11:25:56	nuck	All those thinks make me take the desition to be an ARPA member
2018-10-12 11:26:18	⚡	koenig nods.
2018-10-12 11:26:28	%koenig	It is a pretty good deal in my opinion.
2018-10-12 11:26:30	nuck	Really good tools indeed
2018-10-12 11:26:56	%koenig	There is a big bump up in what you can do between "validated" and "ARPA".  ARPA is well worth the investment.
2018-10-12 11:26:56	nuck	hey, and what if i want to coding in java
2018-10-12 11:27:27	nuck	first ARPA membership before right
2018-10-12 11:27:46	%koenig	Yeah, it looks like it.  The "join" page lists a Java compiler as part of MetaARPA.
2018-10-12 11:28:03	nuck	yeah, thatïs it
2018-10-12 11:28:10	%koenig	Traditionally the way you become MetaARPA is to become ARPA first, then wait for a month (30 days), and then join MetaARPA.
2018-10-12 11:28:12	nuck	great
2018-10-12 11:28:13	nuck	!
2018-10-12 11:28:26	nuck	All right
2018-10-12 11:28:37	%koenig	The MetaARPA donation is a $36 annual donation.  I keep saying I'm going to do it, but then I get busy and don't end up following through.
2018-10-12 11:28:40	nuck	30 days on ARPA first
2018-10-12 11:28:41	%koenig	I should, though.  :)
2018-10-12 11:28:43	nuck	got it
2018-10-12 11:29:15	%koenig	In fairness, I have not heard anybody talking about the Java compiler.  You might want to ask on BBOARD if that is a big attraction to becoming MetaARPA to you.
2018-10-12 11:29:15	nuck	Haha
2018-10-12 11:29:38	%koenig	Occasionally things on the "join" page and things that are actually installed get out of alignment.
2018-10-12 11:29:50	nuck	Yes yes, it is, i work in Java in my job
2018-10-12 11:29:57	%koenig	Although you can request software be installed on the REQUESTS board on BBOARD.
2018-10-12 11:30:00	nuck	then iïll be usefull
2018-10-12 11:30:07	%koenig	Ahh, very nice.  Java is very popular.
2018-10-12 11:30:26	%koenig	Maybe you'll be SDF's Java expert!!
2018-10-12 11:30:31	nuck	Hahhaha... that's better yet
2018-10-12 11:30:38	nuck	Hahahaha
2018-10-12 11:31:00	nuck	yeah, i'm pretty sure of it
2018-10-12 11:32:37	nuck	right, i most to go now

2018-10-15 09:34:50	@strixy	hello, i renewed my MA dues via bitcoin, but no one has confirmed it yet. still getting past-due emails. is anyone able to look into that?
2018-10-15 09:39:06	njsg	I know bitcoin seems to come up once in a while, but is it actually accepted for all payments? I can't even find bitcoin instructions it in the website, or is this through paypal?
2018-10-15 09:39:40	njsg	Well, it could be that or you might still need to wait, how long ago did you pay?
2018-10-15 09:40:17	@strixy	5 days ago
2018-10-15 09:40:36	@strixy	In the past it was confirmed within ~ a day
2018-10-15 09:41:36	@strixy	I also submitted a helpdesk question on SDF proper, so hopefully it gets some attention :)
2018-10-15 09:42:23	njsg	True, and if I'm not mistaken the usual advice is to wait three days, so it's not that (but if it is a manual process, it could always be delayed for some reason)
2018-10-15 09:42:55	njsg	I myself don't have any advice to offer, if you can, idle here for some hours, somebody else might be able to help (though there are no admins here)
2018-10-15 09:42:57	@strixy	Understood
2018-10-15 09:42:59	@mlaine	bboard is the correct channel; no admins here i'm afraid
2018-10-15 09:43:15	@strixy	Thanks @mlaine and @njsg
2018-10-15 09:43:20	njsg	bboard is probably a better place, yes; doesn't hurt to ask here too though
2018-10-15 09:44:11	@mlaine	another option is to mail membership@sdf.org, but, regardless, it pays to just be patient

2018-10-16 12:14:28	%koenig	At the shell, you can say `uinfo ratxue` (or your SDF username) and it will tell you.
2018-10-16 12:15:16	%koenig	I do not find a user named "ratxue" so presumably you have a different SDF username than your IRC nickname.
2018-10-16 12:15:30	ratxue	hmm "sdf:/udd/r/ratxue> uinfo ratxue
2018-10-16 12:15:31	ratxue	cat: /sys/cookies/r/ratxue: Permission denied
2018-10-16 12:15:31	ratxue	//usr/lib/sdf/expire.ksh[40]:  + : unexpected `end of expression'
2018-10-16 12:15:31	ratxue	//usr/lib/sdf/expire.ksh[40]:"
2018-10-16 12:15:53	ratxue	guess not :o)
2018-10-16 12:17:13	%koenig	Yeah, that error shouldn't happen.
2018-10-16 12:17:27	%koenig	But that shell is (I think) a non-validated shell.
2018-10-16 12:17:34	%koenig	Stand by a second...
2018-10-16 12:17:51	njsg	just uinfo should work too, right?
2018-10-16 12:18:11	%koenig	Except the account "ratxue" is in that weird space between created and not created.
2018-10-16 12:18:29	%koenig	So, there's a Unix user "ratxue".  You can `finger ratxue` and see this.  The account exists.
2018-10-16 12:18:36	ratxue	yup
2018-10-16 12:18:49	%koenig	But that same username doesn't appear in the uinfo database.  So you cannot `uinfo ratxue`.
2018-10-16 12:18:57	ratxue	& i think i validates via donate paypal
2018-10-16 12:19:05	ratxue	maybe just impatient 
2018-10-16 12:19:15	%koenig	I suspect (and I think demure also suspects) that there's some error in the account creation process where accounts end up "half created".
2018-10-16 12:19:32	%koenig	And I suspect that's what happened with "ratxue".
2018-10-16 12:19:44	%koenig	But of course I have no way of verifying that hypothesis.
2018-10-16 12:19:49	ratxue	ha
2018-10-16 12:20:09	ratxue	a few things give the ksh errors
2018-10-16 12:20:26	ratxue	so i wondered if was to do with not being validated yet
2018-10-16 12:20:53	%koenig	It's possible, but I seem to remember (waaay back in 2005 before my account was validated) that those things did work before validation.
2018-10-16 12:21:15	ratxue	yeah *does* seem bit sloppy/scary
2018-10-16 12:21:30	%koenig	Hanging out here on IRC is a good strategy to see if someone who hangs around knows better than I remember.
2018-10-16 12:21:43	%koenig	I can tell you that nobody who has administrative privileges hangs out here, though.
2018-10-16 12:21:50	ratxue	ok i'll sit tight here awhile
2018-10-16 12:21:54	ratxue	ah
2018-10-16 12:22:00	ratxue	ok maybe no then :o)
2018-10-16 12:22:29	%koenig	If you hang around on IRC, people who are MetaARPA can validate your account.
2018-10-16 12:22:42	%koenig	But people are mostly only willing to do that if you get to know people and appear friendly.
2018-10-16 12:22:59	ratxue	thing is i'd like to do the arpa $36 thing but not if my $3 is /null 
2018-10-16 12:23:00	%koenig	By validating your account, they are kind of "vouching" for you in a sense, so people don't like to do it for completely unknowns.
2018-10-16 12:23:16	%koenig	I completely understand (and agree with) that sentiment.
2018-10-16 12:23:41	%koenig	If you can manage to make it through the hoops, SDF is a fairly cool place.
2018-10-16 12:24:09	ratxue	yeah get a comfy feeling about the range of stuff on offer
2018-10-16 12:56:08	peteyboy	hey ratxue get in com and i'll validate you
2018-10-16 12:56:23	peteyboy	maybe it'll fix your half state?

2018-10-16 16:31:55	%koenig	ratxue: What happened on your detour into boop?  Did someone follow through and offer to validate you?
2018-10-16 16:32:09	peteyboy	i tried
2018-10-16 16:32:15	peteyboy	but he doesn't show up in uinfo
2018-10-16 16:32:20	peteyboy	either before or after
2018-10-16 16:32:30	peteyboy	no feedback from the validate command either

2018-10-16 16:32:43	peteyboy	must fail silently
2018-10-16 16:32:52	%koenig	Yeah, that was what I was afraid of.
2018-10-16 16:32:52	njsg	time to summon Mulder and Scully?
2018-10-16 16:33:22	%koenig	That account is in that weird "half created" state that people fall into and never seem to get any response about.
2018-10-16 16:36:26	ratxue	lol
2018-10-16 16:37:15	@dmj	"uinfo -v ratxue" returns "no such user." But "finger ratxue" returns a listing, stating "Never logged in."
2018-10-16 16:37:44	@dmj	Finger also states that ratxue checked mail on October 16...
2018-10-16 16:37:51	ratxue	curiouser & curiouser least is not just down to my n00bidity 
2018-10-16 16:38:13	%koenig	It's nothing you did.
2018-10-16 16:38:20	peteyboy	n00bs shouldn't be able to easily break themselves
2018-10-16 16:38:26	ratxue	indeed
2018-10-16 16:38:27	peteyboy	it's the point of all this pre-validation
2018-10-16 16:38:29	peteyboy	(and money)
2018-10-16 16:38:30	%koenig	However, did you happen to notice any weird kind of messages when you created your account?
2018-10-16 16:38:57	ratxue	well the 1st time i saw one of those .ksh messages was on 1st login
2018-10-16 16:39:45	ratxue	actually i did try an initial ssh from a term that was already running screen & it came back to my local prompt so i tried again in a vt0 term
2018-10-16 16:39:52	%koenig	Did you create your account by logging in via SSH as username "new", or did you create your account by typing in your e-mail and preferred login on the https://sdf.org/ page?
2018-10-16 16:40:14	ratxue	did the new ssh thing
2018-10-16 16:40:35	%koenig	Ok.  That's the account creation process that has existed since forever, so it should hypothetically work perfectly.
2018-10-16 16:40:40	ratxue	subsequently i did try login via the web too
2018-10-16 16:41:11	peteyboy	hah that's a bear to deal with anyway
2018-10-16 16:41:14	ratxue	s/vt0/vte
2018-10-16 16:41:33	peteyboy	you mean just checking your mail? or do you mean the applet login?
2018-10-16 16:41:51	ratxue	i haven't checked email afaik
2018-10-16 16:42:21	ratxue	browsed some help man etc popped into boop 
2018-10-16 16:43:05	ratxue	tried nano but it only works in my home dir not subfolders which i can create but nano won't write-out to them
2018-10-16 16:46:44	peteyboy	that feels broken
2018-10-16 16:47:03	peteyboy	you sent mail to membership@
2018-10-16 16:47:08	peteyboy	?
2018-10-16 16:48:00	ratxue	nope
2018-10-16 16:48:20	ratxue	i'll do that if crustymoney proceed cake
2018-10-16 16:54:34	peteyboy	?
2018-10-16 16:54:36	peteyboy	you should now
2018-10-16 16:55:02	peteyboy	i think your account is befunged
2018-10-16 16:56:09	ratxue	ok i just sent a reply to the activation message from membership@ 
2018-10-16 17:00:21	%koenig	That's most likely the best (and only) course of action you have available to you.
2018-10-16 17:00:32	ratxue	gg ty folk
2018-10-16 17:01:54	%koenig	later

2018-10-24 15:49:30	%koenig	That's the permissions on that specific file.
2018-10-24 15:49:34	%koenig	So the error makes sense.
2018-10-24 15:49:42	%koenig	Unfortunately, nobody here can help you with this problem.
2018-10-24 15:50:04	%koenig	I think your only chance is to post the error you are getting on the BBOARD that is called REQUESTS.
2018-10-24 15:50:59	%koenig	I would convey in that post the fact that several of the files under /usr/pkg/lib/ghc-7.6.3/package.conf.d/ have permissions that allow world to read them, but a few are set possibly incorrectly with no world permissions.
2018-10-24 15:51:29	%koenig	Then you have to sit back and wait for someone with root access to repair the permissions or not.
2018-10-24 15:53:35	Partmedia	Thanks for the advice. I don't imagine there's a admins@sdf email address?
2018-10-24 15:54:45	@demure	!faq bboard
2018-10-24 15:54:46	&BASHy2-EU	Anything that requires an Admin should go to the bboard.
2018-10-24 15:54:46	&BASHy2-EU	If you are reading this, your issue will be better handled on the bboard.
2018-10-24 15:54:46	&BASHy2-EU	To run bboard, use the command 'bboard' in the shell. See the man page for help.

2018-10-26 11:22:21	@rcf	I mean, that misconfiguration is annoying for us MetaARPA users as it requires modifying PATH to get git, so you *could* use it anyway, so that the admins take notice and fix it. 
2018-10-26 11:22:26	@rcf	But you didn't hear that from me. :)
2018-10-26 11:22:41	fernan	i assumed it was misconfigured so wanted to make sure...
2018-10-26 11:23:18	fernan	i got burned a couple of times with something similar tmux and cron. been using it not knowing it was misconfigured.
2018-10-26 11:23:41	fernan	then admin found out and locked out a bunch of my stuff
2018-10-26 11:23:57	@rcf	Ah. Probably best to avoid it, then.

2018-10-30 12:45:07	seanh	I managed to backup and verify what `du` on MetaArray shows as 7.4G of data from my local computer to MetaArray using duplicity
2018-10-30 12:45:18	seanh	The backup was done across a couple of few-hours duplicity runs. When backing up if it gets killed, I think running the same duplicity command again will pick up where it left off
2018-10-30 12:46:40	seanh	The verify took a couple of attempts. IIRC what the `duplicity verify` command does is to download _all_ of the data and extract the actual files from it and verify that they match the local files (one file at a time, so you don't need enough free space locally to hold everything at once).
2018-10-30 12:47:07	seanh	This would seem to mean that any files that've been edited or deleted locally cannot be verified which is confusing but I believe that's how it works
2018-10-30 12:48:15	seanh	Anyway, I'm not sure whether running `duplicity verify` again will resume where it left off, if it was interrupted. The first time I ran it the socket got killed after several hours. The second run took several hours again but managed to run until completion
2018-10-30 12:49:16	seanh	If you have enough space locally to store the entire backup you could download the whole backup dir from ma to local using rsync (which definitely _is_ resumable) and then run `duplicity verify` on that local copy, if getting `duplicity verify` direct to SDF to run until completion isn't working
2018-10-30 12:49:42	seanh	^ Just an update on my backing up to ma using duplicity experiment, in case anyone is interested
2018-10-30 12:50:32	@demure	borg uses 'checkmarks' to start up again, and doesn't need to do much talking to the remote point to figure out what to do when restarting
2018-10-30 12:53:01	seanh	I think duplicity is similar, at least when uploading a backup, not sure about recovering and verifying. It breaks your data up into compressed and encrypted files of 200MB each, so presumably if a backup of many GB gets interrupted at least the 200MB files that have already been completely uploaded are already there and don't need to be uploaded again

2018-11-01 10:06:47	+mzafpckw	Hi there!
2018-11-01 10:06:57	+mzafpckw	How can I get validated, please?
2018-11-01 10:07:16	+mzafpckw	One thing is by paying.
2018-11-01 10:08:15	@chals	!faq validate
2018-11-01 10:08:15	&BASHy2-EU	If you want to be validated, the best way to do so is to donate $1 ($3 with paypal) or more to SDF; see http://sdf.org/?join#donate.
2018-11-01 10:08:20	@chals	mzafpckw: ^
2018-11-01 10:08:54	+mzafpckw	What if I know an ARPA member?
2018-11-01 10:09:01	+mzafpckw	Can they validate me for free?
2018-11-01 10:09:32	+mzafpckw	chals: Thank you. I will have a look on the faq.
2018-11-01 10:09:34	@chals	mzafpckw: yes, they can but they will surely want to know you before vouching for you
2018-11-01 10:09:52	+mzafpckw	They know me in person.
2018-11-01 10:10:43	@chals	mzafpckw: not necessarily in person, knowing you online will do
2018-11-01 10:10:51	@chals	would do even
2018-11-01 10:11:09	+mzafpckw	No, really. It's me both with an ARPA account and this random one. May I verify it somehow?
2018-11-01 10:11:45	@chals	mzafpckw: you need to be metaarpa in order to validate someone as far as I know
2018-11-01 10:11:59	@chals	so not arpa, but metaarpa
2018-11-01 10:12:12	+mzafpckw	By the way, how do I check if the account I think is an ARPA one (apart from it not showing the 'validate' message on logout)?
2018-11-01 10:12:17	+mzafpckw	I see.
2018-11-01 10:13:59	@chals	mzafpckw: in order to know check your membership status you can use the id command at the shell, or better id && uinfo 
2018-11-01 10:15:27	@chals	if you are logged into any of the sdf servers you can simply type id && uinfo + username
2018-11-01 10:15:40	@chals	for example id && uinfo mzafpckw 
2018-11-01 10:16:49	+mzafpckw	chals: then my other account (which I thought is paid for) is in some funny state
2018-11-01 10:17:40	+mzafpckw	`id` returns my uuid 57648 and login name in braces, then 'gid=100(users) groups=100(users)'
2018-11-01 10:18:24	+mzafpckw	could you please check out what state is user 57648 in?
2018-11-01 10:18:41	+mzafpckw	I can not run irc there.
2018-11-01 10:18:48	+mzafpckw	(like on this one)

2018-11-01 10:20:13	@chals	I mzafpckw as far as I can see user 57648 is in the users group, not arpa
2018-11-01 10:20:26	+mzafpckw	yes
2018-11-01 10:20:31	+mzafpckw	that's what I am saying
2018-11-01 10:20:38	+mzafpckw	how is that possible? :)
2018-11-01 10:21:07	@chals	mzafpckw: I have no clue, if you were an arpa member it should be a lifetime membership
2018-11-01 10:21:28	@chals	mzafpckw: please post on the bboard or send an e-mail to membership@sdf.org
2018-11-01 10:21:30	+mzafpckw	And if not, is this state valid?
2018-11-01 10:21:45	+mzafpckw	OK, I will send an email, mutt works there. Thank you.
2018-11-01 10:21:58	@chals	you are welcome
