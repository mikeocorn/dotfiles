2018-09-11 14:47:04	@mlaine	evenings
2018-09-11 14:47:25	%koenig	Greetings, mlaine.
2018-09-11 14:49:04	@mlaine	hi koenig
2018-09-11 14:49:08	@mlaine	how's things?
2018-09-11 14:49:35	@mlaine	i'm finally on my obsd host
2018-09-11 14:50:17	@mlaine	i've used it headless during the summer
2018-09-11 14:53:42	%koenig	Excellent!  OpenBSD is so good.
2018-09-11 14:54:11	@mlaine	i'll try and update the kernel, wish me luck (it's been a while since the last update, and i'm rolling snapshots)
2018-09-11 14:54:11	%koenig	Things are pretty decent with me.  I got to code almost the entire day yesterday on my safety analytics machine learning model and that was fun.
2018-09-11 14:54:34	%koenig	I bet it'll work okay, no problem.
2018-09-11 14:54:59	@mlaine	yeah, things usually work well on obsd
2018-09-11 14:55:05	@mlaine	bbl
2018-09-11 14:55:05	%koenig	I did that kind of update to my FreeBSD machine at the beginning of the summer and was pleasantly surprised that it just worked.
2018-09-11 14:55:09	%koenig	good luck
2018-09-11 15:07:52	@mlaine	and he's back!
2018-09-11 15:08:01	%koenig	WooHoo!
2018-09-11 15:08:04	%koenig	Thank Theo.
2018-09-11 15:08:13	%koenig	Although I am not at all surprised.
2018-09-11 15:08:17	@mlaine	hehe
2018-09-11 15:11:43	@mlaine	i've been fiddling with machine learning as well recently
2018-09-11 15:12:59	@mlaine	i haven't used my proper keyboard which has the maltron layout for 5 months, and i can still easily touch type on it
2018-09-11 15:13:27	@mlaine	i'm rather surprised even though i know muscle memory is pretty good in general
2018-09-11 15:15:17	%koenig	I am surprised when I occasionally play a video game that I played as a child and the muscle memory is right there.
2018-09-11 15:15:35	%koenig	Humans are weird.  That stuff gets baked into your brain somewhere and just never goes away.
2018-09-11 15:15:53	@mlaine	yeah :P
2018-09-11 15:18:54	@mlaine	i ordered a spinning bookshelf
2018-09-11 15:19:10	%koenig	You have exquisit taste.
2018-09-11 15:20:57	@mlaine	it was rather expensive, but i've never seen anything quite so cool
2018-09-11 15:21:18	@mlaine	https://boknas.fi/products/images/bok_4_03_tr___1_i.jpg
2018-09-11 15:21:23	%koenig	How is your new flat working out, by the way?
2018-09-11 15:21:32	@mlaine	what an awesome idea
2018-09-11 15:21:32	%koenig	You've been moved in now for a few weeks, I guess.
2018-09-11 15:21:47	@mlaine	just over a week
2018-09-11 15:22:01	%koenig	Ahh, okay.  My mental calendar is a little off.
2018-09-11 15:22:06	%koenig	Wow, that does look really nice!
2018-09-11 15:22:17	@mlaine	i've finally got things cleaned up and am settling in nicely
2018-09-11 15:22:33	%koenig	I always like to see what books people have on their bookshelf when I visit their house.  I think you can tell a lot about people by the books they love.
2018-09-11 15:23:03	@mlaine	the flat is much nicer than the one i had in oulu, even though it's slightly smaller and has no sauna
2018-09-11 15:23:40	@mlaine	the floor plan just makes so much more sense
2018-09-11 15:24:35	@mlaine	i love books
2018-09-11 15:25:59	@mlaine	and indeed i take a careful look at other peoples' libraries
2018-09-11 15:27:06	%koenig	It would be fun to collect a list of all of the books on all of the SDFers bookshelves and find the most commonly represented books.
2018-09-11 15:27:25	%koenig	I bet you'd see trends that deviate from society in general.
2018-09-11 15:28:34	@mlaine	i'm sure :D

2018-09-18 10:46:30	@ecelis	Good day sdf
2018-09-18 10:47:04	@ecelis	online life is becomeing more an anoyance than make things easier, I think about it some times
2018-09-18 10:48:09	@mlaine	how so?
2018-09-18 10:48:14	@ecelis	I can't never figure THE way to sync stuff between accounts/devices personal and business related
2018-09-18 10:48:33	@mlaine	well, don't sync
2018-09-18 10:48:34	@ecelis	I always end copying some stuff maually
2018-09-18 10:49:17	@ecelis	hard to not sync when you wan some files from personal (like music) in a work device (which is allowed)... and that is only one example
2018-09-18 10:49:31	@ecelis	calendars are also a mess :/
2018-09-18 10:50:31	@mlaine	i keep my obsd box at home and just ssh to it from wherever i happen to be
2018-09-18 10:51:27	@mlaine	backups are fine, but syncing stuff across devices, meh, not for me
2018-09-18 10:55:22	@ecelis	I agree not evaeryone needs it, and I happily will get rid of it
2018-09-18 10:55:34	@ecelis	but I can't, at least not right now
2018-09-18 10:55:58	@mlaine	yeah, i'm a man of simple needs (and pleasures)
2018-09-18 10:56:01	@mlaine	:)
2018-09-18 10:56:55	@ecelis	I envy you! :)
2018-09-18 10:57:05	@mlaine	haha
2018-09-18 10:57:11	@mlaine	how's life otherwise?
2018-09-18 10:57:33	@ecelis	I don't want everythong in sync btw, only some stuff, but I'll eventually figure it 
2018-09-18 10:57:40	@ecelis	maybe when I don't need it anymer
2018-09-18 10:58:20	@ecelis	Life goes well, I've been trying new things to do on weekends
2018-09-18 10:58:38	@ecelis	instead of staying at home drinking beer the whole day
2018-09-18 10:58:43	@mlaine	glad to hear :P
2018-09-18 11:00:15	@ecelis	Hiking is one of those, I live near many mountains now
2018-09-18 11:00:37	@mlaine	yay mountains <3
2018-09-18 11:00:44	@mlaine	i envy you :P
2018-09-18 11:01:37	@ecelis	I'd rather like to live near the shore, but mountains are fun also
2018-09-18 11:01:41	%koenig	I have different "lives" in different services.  That's how I sync everything.
2018-09-18 11:01:53	@ecelis	more phisically demanding though
2018-09-18 11:02:08	@mlaine	i live near the shore now
2018-09-18 11:03:04	@mlaine	good afternoon koenig
2018-09-18 11:04:31	%koenig	Hi mlaine and ecelis.
2018-09-18 11:04:39	@ecelis	hello koenig 
2018-09-18 11:05:38	%koenig	Although about keeping lives in sync, I find that I have to have "digital cleanup" events in life every once in a while.
2018-09-18 11:05:48	%koenig	I'm right now cleaning up my GMail inbox because it's so messy.

2018-09-19 04:26:34	@mlaine	what'd you do?
2018-09-19 04:44:45	@odie	i dropped my keys below my mailbox, bent down to reach them and hit the mailbox at it's edge when i got up again
2018-09-19 04:45:00	@odie	super simple, super stupid, super painful ;)

2018-09-19 05:04:29	njsg	lead sucks, water is the future
2018-09-19 05:04:41	njsg	I mean, isn't everybody going "CLOUD CLOUD CLOUD" these days?
2018-09-19 05:09:38	njsg	And the network inkjet printer is back to having troubles, which means I'll probably clean it the same way and after that I should figure a way to make sure this doesn't happen again.
2018-09-19 05:10:22	njsg	I'll just guess the spittoon is too full and that garbage ink is getting back into the "printing head"
2018-09-19 05:11:29	njsg	The problem will be how to clean it thoroughly, short of disassembling every tiny little bit of the printer...
2018-09-19 05:13:09	njsg	And there's always the possibility that is not the problem. But, given how soaking the head in water *did* "fix" the problem...
2018-09-19 05:25:45	@mlaine	odie: ouch
2018-09-19 05:58:52	njsg	odie: that must've hurt. get well soon!

2018-09-19 06:03:12	@odie	the metal corner of the mailbox is like a small sharp spoon
2018-09-19 06:03:30	@odie	i begin to hate my mailbox more and more
2018-09-19 06:31:21	@mlaine	wear a helmet next time :P

2018-09-20 14:30:59	adamd	koenig good afternoon.  You around?
2018-09-20 14:36:51	%koenig	I am.
2018-09-20 14:36:55	%koenig	Just got back, actually.
2018-09-20 14:41:23	adamd	Hows things. I did not want anything specific. Just saying hello. Also wondering if your on Mastodon yet.
2018-09-20 14:41:39	%koenig	haha - I am not on Mastodon yet.  :)
2018-09-20 14:41:44	%koenig	It's on my TODO list!  :)
2018-09-20 14:42:21	%koenig	I'm on PTO next week and people are freaking out right now because I'm on the critical path of 3 projects that the participants can't find their butts with both hands.
2018-09-20 14:42:26	adamd	Ok, just curious.  I am working at home and taking a break.
2018-09-20 14:42:36	%koenig	So we'll see how next week goes for all of those.
2018-09-20 14:42:49	%koenig	Things are pretty good overall, though.
2018-09-20 14:42:58	adamd	That sounds challanging.
2018-09-20 14:43:06	%koenig	I had a major breakthrough on this project I'm doing to automate FEMA audits.  That's cool.
2018-09-20 14:43:28	%koenig	I just got off a call with that team, and casually was able to mention, "Oh yeah, I  have exactly what you're wanting here..."
2018-09-20 14:43:41	%koenig	Then flipped into a screen share and showed it off like it was no big deal.
2018-09-20 14:43:52	%koenig	They were all saying "AWESOME!"
2018-09-20 14:44:12	adamd	Awsome. It took me a minute to figure out but PTO is personal time off?  Spending time with Terri? is it?
2018-09-20 14:44:23	%koenig	Yeah.  Personal Time Off = vacation.
2018-09-20 14:44:54	%koenig	Yeah, Teri's moving to Knoxville next Wednesday.  Movers will load her apartment on Wednesday, she'll drive down here that afternoon, then they'll arrive here Thursday morning.
2018-09-20 14:45:08	%koenig	So I have things mostly ready to go but need to spend some attention starting this weekend.
2018-09-20 14:45:27	%koenig	We want to make her arrival smooth.  Long ago I learned about how it's bad to move a woman into your existing manspace.
2018-09-20 14:45:37	%koenig	But I guess I'm too dumb to learn from experience.  :)
2018-09-20 14:45:46	adamd	Changes can be a lot of fun..
2018-09-20 14:45:46	%koenig	So I'm trying to make it at least as smooth as possible.
2018-09-20 14:45:59	%koenig	Yeah.  I'm looking forward to it.
2018-09-20 14:46:11	adamd	For me I need my time / space but can't stand to be alone all the time.  Its a ballance.
2018-09-20 14:47:04	adamd	Clair and I just try to keep in mind that together is good, seperate is good at times.
2018-09-20 14:47:26	%koenig	She and I are both intensely independent people, which is why we've lived separately for our whole 12 year relationship.
2018-09-20 14:47:33	%koenig	So it'll be interesting to see how this goes.
2018-09-20 14:47:45	%koenig	Also I am mostly giving up my office space, which is going to be tough for me.
2018-09-20 14:48:10	adamd	Live seperately together.  Doing your own things, together. It'll work out.
2018-09-20 14:48:20	adamd	Perhaps with two of you you can get a bigger space?
2018-09-20 14:49:03	%koenig	Yeah, that's the plan.
2018-09-20 14:49:35	%koenig	So the situation is that I don't know how engaged in my current job I am.
2018-09-20 14:49:52	%koenig	So the idea would be that if I stick around as a consultant, I have to have traction.
2018-09-20 14:50:02	njsg	 /clrh
2018-09-20 14:50:26	%koenig	I actually had a pretty long heart-to-heart with one of the managing directors last week at the SE region meeting and in his defense he acted immediately on what I told him.
2018-09-20 14:50:36	%koenig	Like, that I felt like my skillset was not being used well.
2018-09-20 14:50:41	%koenig	So we'll see.
2018-09-20 14:51:07	%koenig	My safety analytics project is starting to get some traction, too, and that's one I've developed completely on my own so it should be easy to show my contribution to the business value there.
2018-09-20 14:51:11	adamd	Some times its amazing what companies will do to keep you.
2018-09-20 14:51:23	%koenig	This place doesn't seem like it cares, honestly.
2018-09-20 14:51:45	adamd	Sounds like a big company. I have worked for big companies and they tend not to care.
2018-09-20 14:51:51	adamd	Small ones appreciate you more.
2018-09-20 14:52:14	%koenig	And today at noon, I worked with my external research group and got some good stuff accomplished, so I think it's highly likely I could take my new skillset and join it to my old supercomputing skillset and land back in a national lab if I wanted to.
2018-09-20 14:52:24	%koenig	Which would be cool.  I like the national labs (most of the time).
2018-09-20 14:52:30	%koenig	Yeah, about small companies.
2018-09-20 14:52:40	%koenig	Big companies are good in that you have resources, etc.
2018-09-20 14:52:43	njsg	FEMA is what, USA federal emergency management agency, or something of the kind?
2018-09-20 14:53:01	%koenig	Small companies are where you can actually get traction.  Each person in a small company usually has to matter.
2018-09-20 14:53:12	%koenig	Yeah, FEMA is exactly what you say.
2018-09-20 14:53:42	adamd	I like the sound of you working at the national lab. So the 1 day I visit I can get a great tour!
2018-09-20 14:53:44	%koenig	So when an area has a disaster, they get funding from FEMA to do the cleanup work.  So those projects get audited and it's typically tons of records that are not well organized.
2018-09-20 14:54:01	%koenig	Even employees can typically not easily get people in.
2018-09-20 14:54:13	%koenig	No kidding that there were people with automatic rifles at my last job.
2018-09-20 14:54:22	adamd	I like guns.
2018-09-20 14:54:34	%koenig	I like guns more when they are not aimed at me.

2018-09-20 15:08:24	%koenig	She and I are both so independent, but we're both excited to be moving together.

2018-09-20 15:37:12	@mlaine	may i ask what made you make the change now after 12 yrs?
2018-09-20 15:37:43	@mlaine	was it always evident, but just never felt so urgent?
2018-09-20 15:38:08	@mlaine	ofc no need to go into details

2018-09-20 15:38:53	%koenig	Thanks, man!
2018-09-20 15:39:13	%koenig	Oh, I'm not shy about sharing these details.
2018-09-20 15:39:27	%koenig	When we met, I was in grad school finishing my PhD.
2018-09-20 15:39:56	%koenig	Then when I finished I took my job at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which was a few states away while she continued in her job that she liked.
2018-09-20 15:40:03	%koenig	So we were long distance.
2018-09-20 15:40:17	%koenig	And one thing led to another and before long, multiple years had gone by...
2018-09-20 15:40:28		adamd has quit (Quit: leaving)
2018-09-20 15:40:43	%koenig	But this is a "0" year for both of us age-wise (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years old, etc.).
2018-09-20 15:40:58	%koenig	So I think both of us are just wanting to land down together in the same place.
2018-09-20 15:41:40	@mlaine	you're 40 now, right?
2018-09-20 15:41:49	%koenig	I'll be 50 in December.
2018-09-20 15:41:52	%koenig	She just turned 40.

2018-09-20 15:58:47	@odie	hey mlaine 
2018-09-20 16:00:35	%koenig	Two of my close high school friends (from which you graduate when you are ~18 years old) have died.  One died of cancer and one died of a heart attack.
2018-09-20 16:01:03	@mlaine	gtg now, see you later
2018-09-20 16:01:05	%koenig	So, life is precious.  You gotta grab hold.  Work is nice, and I especially enjoy accomplishing things with my work, but work is not the only part of life.

2018-09-20 22:35:02	tomasino	hmmm
2018-09-20 22:35:05	tomasino	let me check!
2018-09-20 22:35:13	tomasino	http://tomasino.sdf.org/
2018-09-20 22:35:19	tomasino	i'm still good, but i host on ma.sdf.org
2018-09-20 22:35:28	tomasino	it might be related to the system updates today
2018-09-20 22:38:06	%koenig	ahriman: My site, http://koenig.sdf.org/ which is hosted on the main cluster is not accessible right now.
2018-09-20 22:38:26	%koenig	It's most likely related to the system upgrades, as tomasino said.
2018-09-20 22:39:00	%ahriman	koenig: okedoke, I should just be more patient, then
2018-09-20 22:39:27	%koenig	Patience is the recommended course of action for most things SDF.  :)

2018-09-20 22:39:55	%koenig	It's a great playground to hack on things in, but not a great platform for serious things that absolutely have to work.
2018-09-20 22:40:12	tomasino	that's how i feel about computers in general
2018-09-20 22:40:16	%koenig	heh.
2018-09-20 22:40:47	%koenig	Technologists seem to be the ones who are constantly amazed that aircraft aren't randomly falling from the sky.

2018-09-20 22:42:04	%ahriman	if i needed something with redundancy and high availability it'd be bsd vpses on the west and east coast of the us with load balancing, or some such setup
2018-09-20 22:42:12	⚡	koenig nods.
2018-09-20 22:42:27	%koenig	I'll try to remember to check out your page when we get back on the air.
2018-09-21 00:03:21	%ahriman	koenig: I just checked out your homepage. I'm jealous you get to work with supercomputers.
2018-09-21 00:04:00	%koenig	Yeah, not for the past two years though.
2018-09-21 00:04:13	%koenig	I've been working as a data scientist in industry for the past two years.
2018-09-21 00:04:24	%koenig	But hopefully I'll work with supercomputers again.
2018-09-21 00:05:27	%koenig	Supercomputers are usually used by organizations like the Department of Energy.
2018-09-21 00:06:09	%koenig	Right now DOE is trying to figure out how to better incorporate machine learning, AI, and general data science into what they do.  They're great at computational science and simulation, but not in machine learning and stuff.
2018-09-21 00:06:38	%koenig	So my notion of going out to learn those skills is to maybe go back into DOE and marry those skills with my high-performance computing background.
2018-09-21 00:09:56	%koenig	Ahh, nice!  You run FreeBSD and are a nethacker.

2018-09-21 00:13:49	%ahriman	That's incredible. I want to get into the federal civil service as a blue-collar sys admin. Been hopping between help desk gigs and serving tables at restaurants while I study for the RHCSA and RHCE
2018-09-21 00:14:13	%ahriman	It seems like civilian government work is the way to go as far as job security
2018-09-21 00:15:08	%ahriman	I've been slipping on the nethack though! Just moved to a new house and a new city as of a couple of months ago so I'm re-establishing myself.
2018-09-21 00:15:29	%koenig	That's probably a fair assessment about government work.
2018-09-21 00:15:55	%ahriman	Went from Atlanta to Virginia Beach / Norfolk. Lots of civilian federal gigs here but I need more experience. And it can be a jumping off point since DC is only a couple of hours north if I end up relocating there
2018-09-21 00:16:18	%koenig	In the DOE labs it is rare to find a true government employee, though.  Out of 5,000 people at the lab I worked at, probably 9 were true DOE employees.  The rest were contractors, including myself.
2018-09-21 00:16:36	%ahriman	Interesting, was it for tax reasons?
2018-09-21 00:16:54	%koenig	One thing you should do is to look for job postings for the roles you want and verify the typical requirements.
2018-09-21 00:17:16	%koenig	Many government jobs require you to have a 4-year degree.  That kept a lot of people from getting sysadmin type jobs at the lab.
2018-09-21 00:17:36	%ahriman	I'm very close but about 30 credits shy of a 4-year degree
2018-09-21 00:17:38	%koenig	No, it was more because the DOE doesn't want to hire people directly.  It's easier for them to get rid of people if they are contractors.
2018-09-21 00:17:47	%koenig	Ok, then you'll be okay if you finish it off.
2018-09-21 00:18:08	%koenig	Typically it's pretty hard to lose your job as a contractor, though.
2018-09-21 00:18:23	%koenig	I saw like maybe 5-10 in all my years get let go.
2018-09-21 00:18:35	%koenig	Very rare, mostly contingent on whether you have funding or not.
2018-09-21 00:18:42	%ahriman	That's pretty safe for termination statistics
2018-09-21 00:18:47	%koenig	As a scientist, I always had to write grant proposals to get funding to pay myself.
2018-09-21 00:20:14	%ahriman	Ah I just noticed the time, I should get some rest. Good talking to you, koenig.
2018-09-21 00:20:26	%koenig	Ok, good to meet you.
2018-09-21 00:20:33	%koenig	Hang out on IRC.  Plenty of cool people around.
2018-09-21 00:20:37	%koenig	I'm off to sleep soon too.

2018-09-21 05:13:19	@mlaine	now i'm using some lenovo bulk
2018-09-21 05:17:52	njsg	the newer lenovo keyboards I've seen don't look like keyboards at all
2018-09-21 05:18:09	njsg	I don't know what's this trend of slapping something 1 or 2 mm thick and calling it keys
2018-09-21 05:18:49	njsg	Even if the switch isn't great, it looks weird to me that those little keys would compare to the bigger keys that used to be commonplace
2018-09-21 05:19:01	njsg	Someday I might try unicomp.
2018-09-21 05:19:22	njsg	And this (keyboards) is a good reason to try to always have PS/2.
2018-09-21 05:19:30	@odie	i just brought a keyboard from home to work

2018-09-21 05:20:00	@mlaine	i've been thinking about the same
2018-09-21 05:20:13	@mlaine	but then i'd need a new one for home
2018-09-21 05:20:30	@odie	thats why i bought a newer one for home :)
2018-09-21 05:20:38	@odie	a tenkeyless one
2018-09-21 05:20:39	@mlaine	and i'm a bit unsure about the options
2018-09-21 05:21:06	njsg	The keyboard I've got attached to the terminal is a spring keyboard, but I guess the switches are not like the ones in Model M. It is still better than most.
2018-09-21 05:21:31	@odie	i could never use a spring keyboard here
2018-09-21 05:21:36	@odie	they would kill me
2018-09-21 05:21:45	@odie	not even mx blues
2018-09-21 05:21:49	@mlaine	the new one looks nicer: https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/truly-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboard
2018-09-21 05:22:29	@mlaine	but is not yet available, and with all the "fancy" unneeded stuff will prolly cost and arm and a leg
2018-09-21 05:22:42	@mlaine	s/and/an
2018-09-21 05:22:51	njsg	Just be sure you don't buy some of those new keyboards with "hack" or the like on the name which look like they have not been designed...
2018-09-21 05:22:57	@odie	browse reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards for porn
2018-09-21 05:23:44	@mlaine	i think it'd be good to get one very similar to my current one
2018-09-21 05:23:54	njsg	mlaine: I guess the best would be an IBM 1391411, but those are probably harder to get...
2018-09-21 05:24:22	@mlaine	i don't like the traditional layout
2018-09-21 05:24:59	njsg	Ah. I need the traditional layout, otherwise things get confusing
2018-09-21 05:25:41	njsg	But the most important probably is to have the same layout everywhere, I guess
2018-09-21 05:25:52	@mlaine	i need a split one, since i use maltron (which has e for your left thumb)
2018-09-21 05:26:17	@odie	an affordable option is the Cherry MX Board 3.0
2018-09-21 05:26:19	njsg	This spring keyboard has the '* key in a different place (the return key has a different shape - UK shape maybe?). That's confusing enough.
2018-09-21 05:26:26	@odie	this is what i use in the office
2018-09-21 05:29:20	njsg	Ah, U+2019, must be a fancy UTF8 apostrophe...
2018-09-21 05:29:51	njsg	Now if I could convince emacs to render that as an apostrophe when in latin1...
2018-09-21 05:33:58	@mlaine	i've been eyeing the ergodox...
2018-09-21 05:37:00	njsg	MAFIAA-sponsored research in europe analysed malware at filesharing sites by clicking and following all suspicious links.
2018-09-21 05:37:39	@mlaine	nice
2018-09-21 05:37:50	@mlaine	lunchtime ->
2018-09-21 05:38:14	njsg	I can't say I'm surprised, we live in a world where most rules from 10, 20 years ago to avoid SPAM are now upside down.
2018-09-21 06:26:27	oms_	i bought an ergodox but i can't recommend it
2018-09-21 06:27:02	@mlaine	oh, why is that?
2018-09-21 06:27:07	oms_	i've been using it for months and still haven't gotten used to the square key layout
2018-09-21 06:27:45	@mlaine	that's hardly a fault of the keyboard itself, right?
2018-09-21 06:28:00	oms_	like, c, v, b, t, y; i hit these keys wrong all the time
2018-09-21 06:28:23	oms_	well... isn't it partly a fault of the design of the keyboard?
2018-09-21 06:28:50	@mlaine	it's a question of preference i'd say
2018-09-21 06:30:18	@mlaine	i'm mainly concerned about the more technical aspects
2018-09-21 06:30:28	oms_	it's part myself, yes, but if it has a layout that's different from almost every other keyboard, it's something to know
2018-09-21 06:30:44	@mlaine	like whether or not it feels flimsy etc.
2018-09-21 06:31:04	oms_	have you used a (what's it called... ortholinear, thanks google) keyboard before, and prefer them already?
2018-09-21 06:31:47	@mlaine	i have a 'truly ergonomic' keyboard, with a customised maltron layout
2018-09-21 06:32:42	oms_	ah
2018-09-21 06:32:49	oms_	then you pretty much have an ergodox already, it looks like
2018-09-21 06:33:37	@mlaine	yeah, i was thinking getting another keyboard so i can bring the old one to work
2018-09-21 06:35:57	oms_	flimsy-wise it feels better than a little chiclet keyboard, but certainly not model M hardiness. pretty much at the median
2018-09-21 06:36:12	@mlaine	right
2018-09-21 06:36:58	oms_	i like that it's based on a reprogrammable teensy
2018-09-21 06:37:44	oms_	i've been playing with the idea of making a teensy image for it that turns it into a midi controller
2018-09-21 06:40:55	@mlaine	so how do you program it?
2018-09-21 06:42:14	@mlaine	my current keyboard requires proprietary windows-only software
2018-09-21 06:42:19	@mlaine	which ofc sucks
2018-09-21 06:51:38	oms_	the ergodox ez website has a tool that makes an image from a layout that you make, and then the programming can be done from pretty much anything i think
2018-09-21 06:52:15	oms_	there are also people that have made their own not with the tool that are on github, etc., so if one really wanted to they could compile it themselves without needing the website
2018-09-21 06:53:56	dbucklin	I customize my boards with QMK. It's very achieveable.
2018-09-21 06:55:54	@mlaine	sounds much better
2018-09-21 06:58:27	njsg	ortholinear sounds bad. Of course this is mostly subjective...
2018-09-21 07:00:05	@mlaine	it makes much sense to me at least
2018-09-21 07:01:06	njsg	I immediately think of it as something that's not like the common layouts. But I guess this will be less of a concern.
2018-09-21 07:01:22	njsg	With tablets and all that, we'll probably have trouble finding keyboards within a decade.
2018-09-21 07:01:39	@mlaine	on a traditional keyboard if i, e.g., move my middle finger upwards (straighten it) from 'd', i hit the space between keys 'e', and 'r'
2018-09-21 07:01:49	@mlaine	which is not optimal imo
2018-09-21 07:04:24	dbucklin	mlaine: did it take you some time to get used to the ortho layout?
2018-09-21 07:04:58	@mlaine	difficult to say, because i switched to maltron at the same time
2018-09-21 07:05:25	@mlaine	but all in all it took me a couple of weeks to be able to touch type on it
2018-09-21 07:06:15	@mlaine	http://mlaine.sdfeu.org/pics/kbd.png
2018-09-21 07:06:27	@mlaine	^my layout
2018-09-21 07:06:55	dbucklin	What layout is that?
2018-09-21 07:07:37	@mlaine	maltron, slightly modified to fit the keyboard
2018-09-21 07:09:04	dbucklin	they have their own layout? interesting.
2018-09-21 07:15:53	@mlaine	yeah, it's quite interesting

2018-09-25 14:18:14	+ulcer	i only used precooked recipe to see sunrise time with wyrd, but never actually used remind itself (and not sure of proper way - start daemon from xinitrc, dunno)

2018-09-25 16:18:49	+wayne	maybe you can find another bootdisk, but parted was always excellent for supported all kinds of filesystems. maybe DamnSmallLinux has just enough functionality... good luck!
2018-09-25 16:21:25	njsg	but if damnsmalllinux has linux 2.4 and parted requires linux 2.6...
2018-09-25 16:26:19	+wayne	no, what i meant is burn your CD's using the tools in DSL instead of parted tools (if you can)

2018-09-26 01:37:58	%koenig	I should be in a great mood.  My girlfriend moves in in less than 24 hours.

2018-09-26 01:38:39	%koenig	It will be.
2018-09-26 01:38:50	%koenig	I'm irritated right now, though.
2018-09-26 01:38:59	@odie	remember to never Netflix cheat on her ;)
2018-09-26 01:39:07	%koenig	I have been cleaning my apartment and making space for her stuff, which is great.
2018-09-26 01:39:37	@odie	"this is your drawer"
2018-09-26 01:39:56	%koenig	I was dusting my dresser and for some reason looked inside my jewelry box, which mostly has costume jewelry in it except for a ring box that contains my old wedding ring and my ex-wife's wedding ring.
2018-09-26 01:40:04	%koenig	Except ... I discovered that those rings were missing.
2018-09-26 01:40:19	@odie	uh oh
2018-09-26 01:40:22	%koenig	Now, I'm not one to misplace things easily.  The ring BOX is actually there.  But no rings inside.
2018-09-26 01:40:43	%koenig	And I've turned this place upside down trying to find them.  And I think they are actually stolen.
2018-09-26 01:41:16	%koenig	They would be smart things to steal because they're small and you could sell them.  And they would be unlikely to be easily missed right away.
2018-09-26 01:41:29	@odie	an elegant solution might be to upgrade quickly
2018-09-26 01:41:34	%koenig	ha
2018-09-26 01:42:24	%koenig	Well, we'll see.  I'm in a bad mood tonight because I'm upset about these rings being missing.  I *suspect* that it could be people who had been in my apartment doing repair work during one of the many floods that has plagued my apartment.
2018-09-26 01:42:52	%koenig	And unfortunately I made her cry because I was mad.  So that's probably not the best way to start off having her move in.
2018-09-26 01:42:55	@odie	I'm very sorry koenig 
2018-09-26 01:43:01	%koenig	Thank you.
2018-09-26 01:43:09	@odie	I really hope you are wrong and they will reappear
2018-09-26 01:43:30	@odie	because they would be a disgusting and shitty thing to do
2018-09-26 01:43:42	@odie	stealing something with emotional value
2018-09-26 01:43:44	%koenig	I hope so too.  There's probably a small possibility of that.  Possibly I went crazy one night and moved them.  But it would be weird to not move the ring box with them in it.
2018-09-26 01:43:50	%koenig	Yes.
2018-09-26 01:44:17	%koenig	I mean, it has been 18 years ago since I was married.  But I kept those rings around because there was some attachment to them.
2018-09-26 01:44:28	%koenig	This too shall pass, I guess.
2018-09-26 01:44:40	%koenig	I'm not so happy about people tonight, though.
2018-09-26 01:45:16	%koenig	On the very plus side, I am getting my apartment cleaned in a very deep way that it has needed for a long time.
2018-09-26 01:45:44	%koenig	I have opened up a lot of space in the closet, because I suspect the movers on Thursday morning are going to be bringing a LOT of clothes in.
2018-09-26 01:46:21	%koenig	Amazingly I was able to arrange all of my suits and sports coats and trousers and shirts and neckties into one fairly compact region of the closet, leaving a huge amount of space for her clothes.
2018-09-26 01:51:03	@odie	:D
2018-09-26 01:51:10	@odie	well that is very great
2018-09-26 01:51:29	%koenig	Indeed so.
2018-09-26 01:51:50	%koenig	Tomorrow I only have to free up space in the "computer room" (really, the second bedroom).
2018-09-26 01:52:06	%koenig	She works from home so she needs space in the office to set up her desk.
2018-09-26 01:52:17	%koenig	I should be able to accomplish that, I think.
2018-09-26 01:53:07	@odie	don't want to be impolite but I have to head out for kindergarten and work now
2018-09-26 01:53:10	@odie	sorry

2018-09-26 09:14:05	@odie	hey njsg 
2018-09-26 09:14:33	@odie	whats new on the small linux distro front?
2018-09-26 09:15:00	@elw	What kind of "small" are we talking about?
2018-09-26 09:15:29	njsg	elw: able to run from optical media or floppy while using less than, say, 30 or 20 MiB RAM
2018-09-26 09:15:40	@elw	ooOOoo
2018-09-26 09:15:53	njsg	(because, while it has 64 MiB, I need memory to run the software too...)
2018-09-26 09:17:43	njsg	odie: nothing new yet, just got home, I'll probably leave that for later, when it gets not-so-hot
2018-09-26 09:18:03	@odie	still so hot  in .pt?
2018-09-26 09:18:07	njsg	fortunately, tomorrow it's going to be a bit cooler, with more wind, perhaps.
2018-09-26 09:18:15	njsg	more like so hot again
2018-09-26 09:18:22	@odie	wow
2018-09-26 09:18:28	@odie	summer is gone here
2018-09-26 09:18:33	@elw	Is this a personal project or something public one can follow?
2018-09-26 09:18:50	njsg	I can't say it's in the 40°s because 39 is in the 30°s
2018-09-26 09:19:11	@odie	still far too hot for me
2018-09-26 09:19:15	njsg	But today might be cooler, I don't recall the numbers
2018-09-26 09:19:33	@odie	26 degrees all year, that would be nice
2018-09-26 09:19:40	@elw	39 is still far too hot
2018-09-26 09:20:31	njsg	elw: personal, I want to use a laptop I have around to share a printer, but the laptop has another OS which I would like to leave installed.
2018-09-26 09:20:40	njsg	I had no idea it would be so hard to get that done
2018-09-26 09:20:44	njsg	maybe I should look into freedos...
2018-09-26 09:21:10	njsg	(to resize the filesystem, not to share the printer)
2018-09-26 09:21:16	@elw	Have you looked in to one of the existing small Linux distros like TinyCore?
2018-09-26 09:21:57	njsg	That GNU/linux can run on 64 MiB RAM, there's no question. That used to be my main laptop a decade ago.
2018-09-26 09:22:21	njsg	I have looked into tomsrtbt and damnsmalllinux; I've also tried knoppix although that one doesn't even try to be small
2018-09-26 09:22:50	njsg	a second problem is that the only tool I've found so far to resize the filesystem, parted, requires kernel >= 2.6
2018-09-26 09:23:01	njsg	So tomsrtbt is a no go (2.2), nor is dsl (2.4)
2018-09-26 09:24:09	njsg	I wonder if I need more than 2.6 and mknod (to create /dev/hda or /dev/sda)... probably a shell too. 
2018-09-26 09:25:14	njsg	That or a 2.6 that can mount root from CD/DVD-ROM with no magic involved, with /dev already populated in the CD (but I have no idea if RR allows device nodes, I'd have to check)
2018-09-26 09:25:48	njsg	... eh, scratch that, if I go that route, I could just have / in a USB mass storage device, and it'd be read-write
2018-09-26 09:30:09	njsg	And I didn't try USB boot yet, that's on the to-try/todo list since yesterday

2018-09-26 09:36:30	@odie	tiny core does that
2018-09-26 09:37:03	@odie	its very easy to try and i think its a great distro for some cases
2018-09-26 09:38:00	▬▬▶	m33 has joined #sdf
2018-09-26 09:40:05	@elw	I found TinyCore HDD installation to be difficult (for lack of a better word)
2018-09-26 09:45:52	@odie	:)
2018-09-26 09:46:07	@odie	i guess it feels at home on flash drives
2018-09-26 09:47:36	njsg	from their FAQ, it seems I need microcore
2018-09-26 09:47:44	njsg	tinycore requires 46 MiB RAM
2018-09-26 09:48:17		celadevra has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.1)
2018-09-26 09:48:50	njsg	convenient that microcore isn't mentioned in the download page
2018-09-26 09:52:27	@elw	Their documentation was one of the things I found frustratingly lacking
2018-09-26 09:52:48	njsg	That's going to get worse
2018-09-26 09:52:48	@elw	exactly as you found, some things exist but just aren't mentioned anywhere and you just have to somehow magically know about them
2018-09-26 09:52:59	njsg	Nowadays I get the feeling more and more people just don't care about documentation
2018-09-26 09:53:51		m33 has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.6)
2018-09-26 09:57:19	@odie	https://ftp.nluug.nl/os/Linux/distr/tinycorelinux/3.x/release/
2018-09-26 09:57:39	@odie	looks like there is no microcore anymore from version 4.x on
2018-09-26 09:59:46	njsg	and latest is 9.x
2018-09-26 10:00:11	njsg	So it looks like they went through 6 major releases without updating the FAQ?
2018-09-26 10:05:29	njsg	Their Web-BBS board for microcore seems to have unrealed topics
2018-09-26 10:05:44	njsg	I'd expect a webforum to have some kind of pinned post saying "not available anymore"
2018-09-26 10:11:48	njsg	Okay, now parted gives a *different* error message
2018-09-26 10:12:09	njsg	can't open a file under /tmp, says "(deleted)" after the filename
2018-09-26 10:12:21	njsg	This will end with me reading parted's source, won't it?...
2018-09-26 10:20:42	njsg	Maybe it's a good thing I've not been able to run it yet: https://forums.system-rescue-cd.org/viewtopic.php?p=16058#p16058

2018-09-26 11:02:25	%koenig	You find it interesting due to the energy saving aspects of it or due to the low tech aspects of it directly?
2018-09-26 11:03:03	@odie	yes
2018-09-26 11:03:06	@odie	:)
2018-09-26 11:03:25	%koenig	I do research on building energy efficient supercomputers.
2018-09-26 11:03:35	@odie	ah cool
2018-09-26 11:03:59	%koenig	One of the most advanced places doing that kind of thing is LRZ (Leibniz-Rechenzentrum) in Bavaria.
2018-09-26 11:04:24	%koenig	Most places that run supercomputers do not care very much about energy efficience.  This is especailly in the United States.
2018-09-26 11:04:45	%koenig	Europeans seem to care more about energy efficiency for the sheer sake of making the planet last.
2018-09-26 11:05:01	%koenig	In fact, LRZ is mandated by the government to look into this area.
2018-09-26 11:05:13	@odie	i like the idea of providing something simple like a web site with the smallest possible hardware solution combined with a solar power solution
2018-09-26 11:05:44	%koenig	I suspect this is sort of a "German mentality" of being more conscientious toward the world rather than a "United States mentality" of just burning fossil fuels whenever.
2018-09-26 11:06:10	@odie	i read about a company that wants to place their server racks in private person's basements
2018-09-26 11:06:22	@odie	paying the power plus internet connection
2018-09-26 11:06:25	%koenig	So I was curious about your motivations.  I'm trying to determine whether I believe that Germans (or Europeans) think more mindfully about that type of thing in general.
2018-09-26 11:06:33	njsg	Europeans might care about energy efficiency as far as it does not reach their smartphones
2018-09-26 11:06:39	%koenig	:)
2018-09-26 11:06:53	@odie	and the house owner would heat their water with the heat emitted by the server rack
2018-09-26 11:06:54	%koenig	odie: So what was the reason for putting servers in peoples' basements?
2018-09-26 11:06:55	njsg	If it's a smartphone or webapp or whatever, heaven forbid simple elegant designs
2018-09-26 11:06:56	%koenig	Ahh.
2018-09-26 11:07:35	@odie	this brings some problems like physical security of the rack
2018-09-26 11:07:46	@odie	but its a nice direction of thoughts
2018-09-26 11:07:53	njsg	I didn't read the link, will do later. I personally appreciate simplicity, especially as it lowers the hardware requirements
2018-09-26 11:08:26	%koenig	Stepping away for a bit to find something to eat, but back later.  (Girlfriend just texted that she has turned in her keys and is headed down here.  Should arrive in ~6 hours.)
2018-09-26 11:08:34	@odie	i'm not a energy saver nazi but i try to save energy where it's easy achievable
2018-09-26 11:08:42	@odie	like going by bike instead of the car
2018-09-26 11:08:52	@odie	tuning my heating system
2018-09-26 11:08:59	njsg	Banning android would probably lead to amazing energy savings in europe
2018-09-26 11:09:00	⚡	njsg hides
2018-09-26 11:09:13	@odie	choosing correct lightning inside the house
2018-09-26 11:09:28	njsg	choosing correct lighting is good as far as you don't overdo it
2018-09-26 11:09:43	@odie	yep
2018-09-26 11:09:53	@odie	thats what i meant with the nazi thing ;)
2018-09-26 11:09:58	njsg	telling people they "must buy X", "Y" or "Z" is no good if they must spend 10 times 25 EUR or more to upgrade all the lightbulbs
2018-09-26 11:10:05	njsg	at least now there are affordable LEDs
2018-09-26 11:10:17	@odie	and i don't like to replace regular bulbs with energy saving bulps that include quicksilver
2018-09-26 11:10:33	@odie	i replace when thing sdie
2018-09-26 11:10:35	njsg	but a decade ago, maybe a bit more, it was expensive to buy CFLs, let alone LED lightbulbs...
2018-09-26 11:10:36	@odie	*things die
2018-09-26 11:10:53	@odie	because its not a good idea to throw working stuff away
2018-09-26 11:11:00	njsg	that's never a good idea
2018-09-26 11:11:13	njsg	even keeping broken stuff might be a good idea 
2018-09-26 11:11:17	njsg	unless it's a phone
2018-09-26 11:11:27	njsg	phones have to be upgraded every once in a while to run google software
2018-09-26 11:11:31	@odie	like when they closed down a nuclear plant that got new fuel rods a few months ago
2018-09-26 11:11:49	@odie	that is a waste of energy
2018-09-26 11:11:57	njsg	remember to reduce your waste, except if it is about smartphones.
2018-09-26 11:12:00	@odie	since they can tun a year
2018-09-26 11:12:35	njsg	it might be worse when they constantly try to keep an NPP running despite the environmental hazards
2018-09-26 11:12:38	@odie	ok, i get it. you have a problem with smartphones and people changing them like underwear ;)
2018-09-26 11:12:50	njsg	was it Almaraz that is still active?
2018-09-26 11:13:03	@odie	i don't know about that
2018-09-26 11:13:21	@odie	it was a plant 25km from where i live
2018-09-26 11:13:37	@odie	the shutdown wasn't because it was too old
2018-09-26 11:13:58	njsg	odie: I have a problem with the software development and standards culture that finds it acceptable to use tools that are constantly updated in ways that require smartphone upgrades. It's like the Microsoft Monopoly, but much faster paced.
2018-09-26 11:13:59	@odie	it was because germany wanted to drop nuclear power as a energy source
2018-09-26 11:14:10	njsg	This is all personal opinion, let people do whatever they want.
2018-09-26 11:14:35	@odie	yeah, i know what you mean. but isn't it the same with regular PCs?
2018-09-26 11:14:42	njsg	It'll just be quite funny if some of the people doing exactly that are the same people who're all excited about saving the environment...
2018-09-26 11:14:52	@odie	even websites can make people upgrade their hardware
2018-09-26 11:14:57	njsg	odie: it starts becoming like that, yes.

2018-09-26 11:16:14	njsg	at least back then you had that problem if you used windows *and* you'd have to worry about it only once in a while, and you could relax for a couple years. Nowadays, rolling-release is a common trend...

2018-09-26 11:16:58	njsg	I was siding along with AMD because their FLOSS drivers for X11 and linux seemed to have better support

2018-09-27 10:13:20	%koenig	Her stuff is now moved in.  There is a LOT of stuff in my apartment right now.  Almost an overwhelming amount.
2018-09-27 10:13:30	@odie	but you are not married, right?
2018-09-27 10:13:32	%koenig	Yes, it was my old wedding ring and my ex-wife's wedding ring.

2018-09-27 16:04:17	%koenig	2.88 MB is not a standard floppy diskette size.
2018-09-27 16:04:41	%koenig	1.44 MB would be the standard size for a 3.5" diskette.
2018-09-27 16:04:53	%koenig	1.2 MB would be the standard size for a 5.25" diskette.
2018-09-27 16:05:26	%koenig	It's possible that the BIOS on the laptop does not understand how to boot a 2.88 MB floppy diskette.
2018-09-27 16:05:52	%koenig	If you can do so, I'd recommend trying to make a 1.44 MB boot floppy that contains COMMAND.COM, and the two hidden .SYS files.

2018-09-29 02:48:06	njsg	demure: new enough to have CD boot support but old enough to not have USB mass storage boot support
2018-09-29 02:48:30	njsg	The CD boot either works only with the original CD drive or only with Secondary Master
2018-09-29 02:48:49	njsg	Because it's definitely not working now, but it is in the list
2018-09-29 02:49:05	njsg	"Removable devices" probably means "what is installed in the FDD bay"
2018-09-29 02:49:35	njsg	Or maybe something from the docking station, if there's one for this model.

2018-09-29 04:49:33	njsg	I might try upgrading the laptop memory again. I opened it a couple days ago, did some cleaning and inspection
2018-09-29 04:50:33	njsg	And it turns out the memory slot in use was not securing the module properly, so maybe that's why it didn't boot when I tried a larger memory module.
2018-09-29 04:55:37	@fmoonII	think you can fix the slot?
2018-09-29 04:58:33	njsg	no idea, but not a big worry right now, as it has 2 slots
2018-09-29 04:58:59	njsg	they're different, in one the module is secured only by plastic, that's the one that is ok
2018-09-29 05:00:18	njsg	in the other, there are also those metallic... lever-fasteners?

2018-09-29 06:21:56	njsg	After all this trouble, it ought to be noted that the newer versions of GNU parted cannot resize filesystems
2018-09-29 06:29:35	@odie	if your laptop supports dual channel ram (or whatever it is called) you could benefit from two memory modules if you can fix the damaged slot
2018-09-29 06:30:47	njsg	I doubt so, isn't dual channel from the DDR era?
2018-09-29 06:31:08	njsg	this is plain SODIMM, no DDR*
2018-09-29 06:32:42	@odie	wikipedia sais, dual channel is used from the early 2000s on
2018-09-29 06:32:47	njsg	I'm appalled by the lack of linux resizing tools, it seems the only thing I've found so far that would work is gparted, which implies X11, which implies "uses too much RAM". Now, fatresize, first I'd need to find a live CD/DVD that has it
2018-09-29 06:33:01	@odie	what laptop do you have?
2018-09-29 06:33:28	@odie	and what sodimm modules does it support
2018-09-29 06:33:43	njsg	regular SODIMM
2018-09-29 06:34:09	njsg	I think that used to be a memory time until new types of SODIMM/DIMM memories appeared
2018-09-29 06:35:14	njsg	I'm not sure about the voltage, I'd have to check
2018-09-29 06:36:01	@odie	do you have the manual or can you find one on the net?
2018-09-29 06:36:06	@odie	for your laptop?
2018-09-29 06:36:53	@odie	in a perfect world, it should mention such feature
2018-09-29 06:37:19	njsg	Would dual channel exist with non-DDR memories?
2018-09-29 06:37:52	@odie	ah
2018-09-29 06:38:04	@odie	no. it needs at least DDR1
2018-09-29 06:38:16	@odie	well, DDR
2018-09-29 06:38:24	njsg	okay, then we can be sure it doesn't have that :-P
2018-09-29 06:38:53	@odie	:)
2018-09-29 06:39:02	@odie	so you can ignore the damaged slot and carry on ;)

2018-09-29 08:29:42	njsg	As far as it supports booting from floppy, of course
2018-09-29 09:47:20	njsg	I may have found a way to boot the problematic live CDs...
2018-09-29 09:59:48	njsg	Easier said than done, I have to figure out what's the right way to do it

2018-09-29 14:04:28	njsg	Until I opened the laptop, did the cleaning and changed the slot, there would be times it'd not boot at all or complete POST, it could easily have been because of the memory slot...
2018-09-29 14:04:38	njsg	Either way, I should be able to get at least 128, if not 256
2018-09-29 14:04:56	njsg	I wasn't expecting this, but I'll still be looking for a good small FAT resizer
2018-09-29 14:05:06	njsg	such a thing should exist.

2018-09-30 02:33:48	njsg	demure: I only have 1 other machine that might or might not take that hard drive. And I forgot I could try it with that machine.
2018-09-30 02:34:10	njsg	The interface is 2.5" PATA, and I don't have any adapter for 3.5"
2018-09-30 02:35:27	njsg	Maybe I should get one someday? https://img.fasttechcdn.com/101/1012900/1012900-4.jpg

2018-09-30 04:59:49	@jkrueger	wow, BBOARD now has a fountain pen topic, wonder if there should be a pen channel here?
2018-09-30 05:01:01	@jkrueger	mlaine: you still use your fountain pen?
2018-09-30 05:03:21	@mlaine	yes i do :)
2018-09-30 05:05:12	@jkrueger	My son now a Dr. of physics uses dip pens to do his math, do you use such?
2018-09-30 05:05:48	@mlaine	i'd like to get one
2018-09-30 05:06:00	@jkrueger	... of course computer too.
2018-09-30 05:07:40	@jkrueger	Funny being an artist don't like working with dip pens. :)
2018-09-30 05:08:24	@mlaine	why is that?
2018-09-30 05:11:01	@jkrueger	Perhaps portability and constant flow of ink, now have one of my pens as an eyedropper which writes for days.
2018-09-30 05:11:51	@mlaine	yeah, they're not very practical
2018-09-30 05:11:51	@jkrueger	... whole barrel is ink supply.
2018-09-30 05:16:59	@jkrueger	Now have 8 fountain pens each with a different size nib, needlepoint to 1.9mm music nib, use all every day.
2018-09-30 05:18:02	njsg	I don't know, my experience with cartridges is that it's ok, I mean, you may have to replace often if you write a lot, but that's just open, replace, close again.
2018-09-30 05:19:16	njsg	The least practical aspect of that was probably the price of cartridges, and at some point I would mostly refill at home.
2018-09-30 05:20:09	njsg	But I'd still have to carry regular cartridges in case I'd run out of ink, or find a way to seal a refilled cartridge properly.
2018-09-30 05:20:59	@jkrueger	Well, I'm working on a manuscript, cursive and drawings and running out of ink, Every day. :(
2018-09-30 05:21:01	njsg	oh, was that about dip pens?
2018-09-30 05:21:12	njsg	yeah, that'd be less practical
2018-09-30 05:21:58	@jkrueger	njsg: you could switch to a converter.
2018-09-30 05:22:53	njsg	jkrueger: I might have done something wrong, I think the converter wouldn't that much ink compared with a cartridge
2018-09-30 05:24:31	@jkrueger	Perhaps, depending on pen and converter size.
2018-09-30 05:27:36	@jkrueger	I write about 5-10 pages a day so have one pen converted to eyedropper, whole barrel filled with ink.

2018-09-30 13:34:50	kc8yho	lovin the tAILS OS  everything going through it goes through tor lol 
2018-09-30 13:34:55	kc8yho	invisible 
2018-09-30 13:36:29	kc8yho	anyone else try it ?
2018-09-30 13:36:40	kc8yho	or what is your favorite usb key distro ?
2018-09-30 13:37:21	@demure	odie: try the new logitec vert trackball
2018-09-30 13:37:42	@odie	demure: it's pretty expensive and has a built in battery
2018-09-30 13:37:47	@demure	oh, that might have just been a new vert mouse >_>
2018-09-30 13:38:06	@demure	rechargeable mouse batteries ftw 
2018-09-30 13:39:20	@odie	don't know why they discared the good old AA cell
2018-09-30 13:41:24		adamd has quit (Quit: leaving)
2018-09-30 13:57:45	njsg	odie: was too easy and cheap to replace, it'd be harder to make money
2018-09-30 13:57:49	njsg	"Vendor lock-in", etc.
2018-09-30 13:58:11	kc8yho	demure, you ever try the tails OS ?
2018-09-30 13:58:24	njsg	It's alarming that now even phones are getting into that trend, there are newer phones where you can't easily remove the battery
2018-09-30 13:59:46	@demure	The AA battery isn't a particularly good battery. There are many ways that modern batteries -- especially rechargeable ones -- are significantly better.   
2018-09-30 13:59:56	njsg	like LSD AA batteries?
2018-09-30 14:00:06	@demure	this is why most good flashlights don't bother with AA
2018-09-30 14:01:01	njsg	if the problem is in the specification and can't be solved by changing the underlying battery technology, then I'd suggest coming up with a different, equally encompassing standard
2018-09-30 14:01:27	njsg	not some vendor-specific format nobody else uses, not some patented thing
2018-09-30 14:01:42	njsg	now AA batteries being bad doesn't make vendor-specific batteries good
2018-09-30 14:02:06	@demure	I would say that the issue here is two part 1) the waste of non rechargeable 2) the poor specs of what common people would call common batteries  
2018-09-30 14:02:23	@demure	AAA, AA, etc all have piss poor specs
2018-09-30 14:02:40	njsg	I know widespread standard adoption won't suddenly happen, but one thing is going your own way but making it possible, another thing is deliberately making it hard, expensive or impossible
2018-09-30 14:02:42	@demure	which is why there are so many other battery types
2018-09-30 14:03:34	kc8yho	ok i must be chopped liver :P
2018-09-30 14:03:37	njsg	I'm not sure that's the only, or the main reason...
2018-09-30 14:03:53	njsg	Are LSD batteries *that* bad?
2018-09-30 14:05:14	njsg	And using AA rechargeable batteries allows a nice backup plan where you can buy nonrechargeable batteries if all else fails.
2018-09-30 14:08:31	@odie	I use rechargable AA batteries in my trackballs and they last 6-8 months
2018-09-30 14:08:33	njsg	Smartphones might have needs that AA or NiMH LSD cannot fulfill, but I have no idea about the specific details, and what might or might not be a problem.
2018-09-30 14:08:39	@odie	eneloop batteries
2018-09-30 14:09:17	@odie	a mosue or trackball just don't draw that much power
2018-09-30 14:09:20	@odie	*mouse
2018-09-30 14:09:48	@demure	for the usecase of a mouse, I would say that your hours of use per day would effect your AA burn through. the good rechargeable mice, like logitech, can be used and charged at the same time    
2018-09-30 14:09:49	njsg	With that kind of devices the problem used to be that non-LSD rechargeable AA/AAA batteries would discharge quickly
2018-09-30 14:10:08	njsg	But, with LSD, that problem goes away
2018-09-30 14:10:22	@demure	and then you don't have to pull a AA out your ass then you need your mouse to work, you just plug it in and keep using it
2018-09-30 14:10:36	njsg	they're good exactly for that kind of uses, low-power devices where a non-rechargeable battery would last for ages
2018-09-30 14:11:06	njsg	(eneloop is a brand of LSD batteries, by the way)
2018-09-30 14:11:47	@odie	oh
2018-09-30 14:12:10	@odie	njsg: didn't know that. never heard of LSD in this context
2018-09-30 14:13:11	njsg	I suppose it might not be a popular acronym for some reason.
2018-09-30 14:13:13	@odie	the only non rechargable AAA or AA I use are those, that come with new devices
2018-09-30 14:13:19	njsg	But it pops up once in a while
2018-09-30 14:13:25	@odie	otherwise I only use rechargable ones
2018-09-30 14:13:38	@odie	even in my cat flap
2018-09-30 14:13:38	njsg	"Low Self-Discharge"
2018-09-30 14:13:50	@odie	where they last over 6 months
2018-09-30 14:14:50	njsg	Maybe there is a good de facto standard battery format that could be used for phones and similar devices, if there isn't one, it'd be nice to see such a thing in the future.
2018-09-30 14:15:37	njsg	But that's hardly gonna happen without any sort of regulation making it more expensive or less feasible to do otherwise.
2018-09-30 14:15:58	@odie	or like what they did with USB
2018-09-30 14:15:58	@demure	I would be very skeptical of making a 'standard' cell phone battery until we have vast improvements to the size of battery tech  
2018-09-30 14:16:30	@demure	as phones, like laptops, push the boundary of small form factors
2018-09-30 14:16:33	njsg	Or, like some would say, it's the kind of thing where you can "vote with your wallet".
2018-09-30 14:16:51	njsg	I'm skeptical too, indeed.
2018-09-30 14:16:56	njsg	Now it'd still be nice.
2018-09-30 14:17:08	njsg	But I say there are changes that wouldn't be needed
2018-09-30 14:17:13	njsg	both in phones and laptops
2018-09-30 14:17:51	@odie	they should at first disallow devices like electrical razors with built in batteries
2018-09-30 14:17:56	njsg	I think now they are even using the "saves space" thing to remove 8P8C for ethernet...
2018-09-30 14:17:59	@odie	or stuff like that
2018-09-30 14:18:17	@demure	I don't see why you don't like built in rechargeable batteries so much... 
2018-09-30 14:18:34	njsg	I can see it -- some companies will claim being able to access the battery will be a safety hazard
2018-09-30 14:18:49	njsg	I can also imagine one of those companies would be Samsung.
2018-09-30 14:18:53	@demure	they are, in our current market, so so so much better then shoving in disposable AA's... and that is ASSUMING that AA's would give enough power for proper operation
2018-09-30 14:19:09	njsg	Replacing your official Samsung-branded battery with a third party battery might expose you to unexpected safety risks
2018-09-30 14:19:16	@demure	and if a device could use AA's, the majority of users will NOT be putting recharable batteries in...
2018-09-30 14:19:19	@odie	because people throw away perfectly good devices just because the battery is dead
2018-09-30 14:19:50	njsg	demure: but at least those who want to put in rechargeable ones could put.
2018-09-30 14:20:21	@demure	I think you are taking the wrong approach to what I think you see the issue is (which I may be wrong on) 
2018-09-30 14:20:27	njsg	not being able to access the battery is something that should be forbidden through regulations
2018-09-30 14:20:44	@demure	If all devices were made so you could open them and change the battery, then you could have the option to put someone else's battery in
2018-09-30 14:20:47	njsg	not being able to open a computer or phone too, by the way, but that idea will be a bit harder to "sell"
2018-09-30 14:20:56	njsg	demure: but that's the point!
2018-09-30 14:21:08	@demure	but saying that you need to be able to use the crappiest of standards (AA), is a shit goal
2018-09-30 14:21:08	njsg	That *is* *the* point
2018-09-30 14:21:50	njsg	No, I simply say that is a much better format, right now, than the vendor-specific batteries
2018-09-30 14:22:11	@odie	that's why I'm able to buy old camera - because I can replace the battery in them
2018-09-30 14:22:25	njsg	Now if there were something comparable, but with specifications that are more suitable for phones and other devices...
2018-09-30 14:22:28	@odie	cameras
2018-09-30 14:22:40	@demure	I disagree, as AA are vastly inferior to most of the single device batteries we are comparing to right now
2018-09-30 14:22:40	njsg	Fortunately there are digital cameras that take in AAs.
2018-09-30 14:22:54	njsg	Sure, AAs might run out quickly if you use the flash often
2018-09-30 14:23:06	njsg	but at least you can buy rechargeable AAs from any vendor
2018-09-30 14:23:14	njsg	and you can buy non-rechargeable ones in an emergency
2018-09-30 14:23:26	@demure	the whole AA spec doesn't hold to modern (non low use) power needs.
2018-09-30 14:23:41	njsg	demure: that's not an argument to restrain consumer freedom
2018-09-30 14:23:58	njsg	I mean, I don't think that's a good reason to
2018-09-30 14:24:03	njsg	because anything can be an argument
2018-09-30 14:24:14	@demure	if this discussion was about a hypothetical new standardization, i may be able to see your point
2018-09-30 14:24:40	njsg	From my point of view, this discussion was more about consumer freedom and fighting vendor lock-in than about AA batteries
2018-09-30 14:24:41	@demure	maybe I'm seen an artificial connection to the example in the discussion  
2018-09-30 14:25:07	njsg	it's just that the AA format is what I see that better illustrates what could be an ultimate solution, but of course there would be no single format to rule them all
2018-09-30 14:25:11	@demure	but I have the same issues when people try to say that phones need a 100 3.5mm headphone jack.
2018-09-30 14:25:20	@demure	*100 year old
2018-09-30 14:25:55	@demure	fuck AA >_> there are so many better standardized batteries
2018-09-30 14:36:10	@odie	i don't care how the battery is called as long as I can buy it easily

2018-09-30 16:43:50	njsg	ah.
2018-09-30 16:44:10	njsg	Even if the GPU did support it, it could be that the driver would be more limited
2018-09-30 16:44:25	njsg	But well, drivers, as far as it shows the right colours, it's usable...
2018-09-30 16:44:57	njsg	(That ought to be implicit, but I learned with radeon that it's never too much to presume the obvious might be missing)
2018-09-30 16:48:00	@niro	njsg: yeah, I checking into a possible drivers issue during my system revamp yesterday. Got that figured out for this gpu (AMD/ATI Radeon HD 5870)
2018-09-30 16:48:15	@niro	oooold, but still does the thing
2018-09-30 16:54:51	@niro	Looking into a full platform upgrade using a Ryzen 5 2600 or if budget allows a Ryzen 7 2700x
2018-09-30 16:57:36	@niro	maybe throw a GTX 1060 or a Radeon RX 580 in

2018-09-30 18:08:00	njsg	Next time I buy a GPU, I'll probably be a lot more picky.
2018-09-30 18:09:13	njsg	And I'll likely do my best to avoid actively-heated ones. They need to be cooled, but, in my experience, drivers for linux might have some issues regarding fan management...
2018-09-30 18:10:25	njsg	The driver "market" isn't good either, support for "not so new" cards will get dropped once in a while, sometimes from closed drivers (sometimes just as a consequence of external changes in Xorg, mesa, ...) and soemtimes from open drivers too (which is even more worrying)
2018-09-30 18:10:41	njsg	But it's not like free licenses imply or require better hardware support, heh.
2018-09-30 18:11:29	njsg	s.soem.some.

2018-10-01 14:25:12	njsg	in fact, I think with windows 98 I have more control and flexibility during the install than with debian

2018-10-01 17:14:50	njsg	so it looks more like it can't even be changed to sysvinit
2018-10-01 17:14:53	njsg	or am I missing something?
2018-10-01 17:15:08	njsg	no openrc in the package list either
2018-10-01 17:15:20	njsg	or maybe I need to get networking working to get the full package list
2018-10-01 17:15:51	njsg	I have no idea, the installer simply refused to configure the apt-get sources correctly in the absence of an internet connection
2018-10-01 17:16:13	njsg	and the network card isn't working, I need to check in the other OS. Could it be that it somehow got broken?

2018-10-01 17:18:02	@chals	I didn't know sysvinit had been dropped from the distribution, that is weird
2018-10-01 17:19:29	@chals	oh I see it is in sid, so it was probably removed from stable due to a bug

2018-10-01 17:21:20	njsg	It should at least show some identification, I think?
2018-10-01 17:21:42	njsg	I mean, it detects there is a card, and that's as much as I get from the linux side as well

2018-10-01 18:51:51	njsg	fmoonII: Yeah, I guess my problem is that I need networking to add more apt(?) sources
2018-10-01 18:51:57	njsg	Sadly, there's the NIC problem as well

2018-10-02 17:22:55	njsg	fmoonII: lack of physical keyboard, a problem some may say is a feature; irssi connectbot is connectbot tailored for irssi, I don't recall anymore what are the differences
2018-10-02 17:23:08	njsg	connectbot being another ssh client for android
2018-10-02 17:24:01	njsg	multitap input box: a separate input box controlled by the ssh client (as opposed to the irssi input line), I probably could have described that better
2018-10-02 17:25:18	njsg	multitap being the non-magic way to input text with a standard(?) GSM keypad
2018-10-02 17:33:17	@fmoonII	hmm. I'd probably understand better if I'm shown
2018-10-02 17:40:18	njsg	Its the 123,456,789,*0# keys in a cell phone and pressing, say, 2 three times to get "c", that's called multitap. The samsung keyboard allows this (but calls it something else, 4x3 I think). This can be done in irssi connectbot, it's all on the (software) keyboard side
2018-10-02 17:41:00	njsg	What I wanted was a client-side input buffer/textbox.
2018-10-02 17:41:34	njsg	At one point, I'll actually try to write down precisely what I want, one thing I really must do is hack my own software keyboard for android
2018-10-02 17:46:11	@fmoonII	ohh ok, I think I understand somewhat better now
2018-10-02 17:47:04	@fmoonII	so what you want is a way to have this kind of input for all apps, I guess?
2018-10-02 17:48:40	▬▬▶	jerrod has joined #sdf
2018-10-02 17:50:22	njsg	Actually no, that's where I could have explained and worded it way better. Looking at it now, I'd say that what I wanted was really just to have a client-side input field.
2018-10-02 17:51:21	njsg	And there's something else I wanted, that is *not* multitap, to make things even more confusing.
2018-10-02 17:51:34	@fmoonII	so just some space where you SEE what you typed?
2018-10-02 17:52:11	@fmoonII	apart from irssi's input box
2018-10-02 17:52:19	@fmoonII	line
2018-10-02 17:52:25	njsg	yes
2018-10-02 17:52:32	@fmoonII	ok, makes sense now
2018-10-02 17:52:56	njsg	I wanted also the ability to have the "single tap" way to use that keyboard (with dictionary-based guessing, some manufacturers call that T9 (nokia?)).
2018-10-02 17:53:21	njsg	I probably didn't even think about what I was writing because, with the current samsung keyboard, that "single tap", when enabled, works only when there's such an input box
2018-10-02 17:53:36	@fmoonII	yes, T9 I know of, also
2018-10-02 17:55:06	njsg	but I think having a client-side input box would at least make it less frustrating to write with that keyboard (because of the latency)
2018-10-02 17:55:45	@demure	git is still broken on the cluster :/
2018-10-02 17:56:06	njsg	I won't say I'd have done this software keyboard differently if I had designed the phone, because if I had designed the phone, it'd have a real keyboard/keypad...
2018-10-02 17:56:29	njsg	And that's one thing I'd say n900 did well
2018-10-02 17:56:48	njsg	(That phone seems to be widely appreciated?)

2018-10-02 18:16:29	njsg	... a newspaper here referred to Berners-Lee as "Internet's father"
2018-10-02 18:17:10	njsg	I didn't know CERN was part of DARPA
2018-10-02 18:17:58	@fmoonII	for most normal people, the web is the internet ;/
2018-10-02 18:18:05	njsg	But I guess it was a secret project to establish a base in Europe so that the USA would have greater chances of winning WWIII.
2018-10-02 18:20:10	njsg	Well, a newspaper should at least give their best to be correct, while also reaching the masses (when that is their goal, of course). 
2018-10-02 18:21:07	@fmoonII	I certainly agree
2018-10-02 18:23:34	njsg	I see this as a place where they could have easily done a much better job, and I see what they did as a good litmus test to see if their tech-related articles are worth reading...
2018-10-02 18:31:03	@fmoonII	you might even think: If they aren't precise in tech maybe they also aren't in other topics where you as a 'uninformed person' might get the wrong idea about a topic
2018-10-02 19:19:19	njsg	I'm too sleepy, might be a good idea to hit the sack...

2018-10-03 03:05:21	grugly	evenings sir
2018-10-03 04:03:56	njsg	grugly: I'd just not say "for most people", I'd require a good statistical backing of that (just because nowadays "most people" gets overused).
2018-10-03 04:04:12	njsg	But I'd probably go with "misinformed people"
2018-10-03 04:04:53	njsg	There's no reason all internet users can't learn what the internet is, but maybe the push towards "intuitive is having no teaching" is doing more harm than good in some places?
2018-10-03 04:06:27	njsg	IT classes in mandatory education can also fail at teaching, where they have an excellent opportunity to introduce a few UIs and the UI concepts, they might just work directly with one specific system and trade knowledge that would be useful across several systems for vendor-locked knowledge

2018-10-03 05:16:39	@mlaine	hi koenig
2018-10-03 05:16:41	@mlaine	how's you?
2018-10-03 05:18:26	njsg	Sometimes, I can't understand planning...
2018-10-03 05:19:28	%koenig	I am well.  I am sitting in an airport waiting to go on a business trip to meet a new client.
2018-10-03 05:19:35	njsg	They're seriously pushing to close one of the runways at LIS, at from the comments of those opposed to the idea, it looks like, while it is not heavily used (under 1%, management says), it is used under certain weather conditions that render the other one unusable...
2018-10-03 05:20:03	njsg	I'd say that's a good reason to keep it open
2018-10-03 05:20:24	%koenig	It's definitely going to come down to a cost:benefits analysis.
2018-10-03 05:20:50	%koenig	They'll know how much it costs to keep it running vs. how much it would cost in lost business due to those weather-related cancellations.
2018-10-03 05:20:59	%koenig	They'll just eat that weather-related cost, I bet.
2018-10-03 05:21:19	%koenig	The airline industry is one place where those types of optimizations are very well known and used a lot.
2018-10-03 05:21:21	njsg	I don't know, I think they'd want to avoid shutting down operations
2018-10-03 05:21:42	njsg	But there's a whole mess here right now because there's always some "let's make another airport" idea 
2018-10-03 05:22:22	njsg	Which invariably involves making or upgrading an airport farther from Lisbon, which I also think is a bad idea
2018-10-03 05:22:44	njsg	newest idea is to do load balancing between the existing and the new airport
2018-10-03 05:22:52	njsg	would be great, except for the river that sits between them
2018-10-03 05:23:00	@mlaine	koenig: how'd the move go?
2018-10-03 05:31:18	%koenig	It went fairly well.
2018-10-03 05:31:26	%koenig	She brought about 60 boxes, which was a lot.
2018-10-03 05:31:54	%koenig	Fortunately I planned at least a bit for that type of situation so I had plenty of places that I could free up so we could stow boxes.
2018-10-03 05:32:28	%koenig	She also brought a few big things like her desk and some tables and a couch.
2018-10-03 05:32:36	@mlaine	60 boxes is a lot indeed
2018-10-03 05:32:59	%koenig	It is all moved in and her areas in the apartment are cleaned up and structured.  My areas, not so much.
2018-10-03 05:33:28	%koenig	But now we are back to work, so we will have to work on that going forward.
2018-10-03 05:33:28	@mlaine	do you have a large house/apartment?
2018-10-03 05:33:39	@mlaine	ofc
2018-10-03 05:35:38	%koenig	Not too much.  1300 sq. feet.

2018-10-03 15:00:31	adamd	Hello demure, any fun projects today?
2018-10-03 15:00:53	@demure	I've been doing some nerf modding
2018-10-03 15:01:10	@demure	Have a fly wheel replacement kit. And need to do some soldering
2018-10-03 15:01:23	⚡	adamd googles nerf modding.
2018-10-03 15:01:55	adamd	Like a Nerf gun?
2018-10-03 15:02:20	@demure	For spring nerfs, there are simple things like air flow restrictor removals, and spring replacements
2018-10-03 15:02:22	@demure	Yep
2018-10-03 15:02:42	@demure	There also see to be a shit ton of 3d print mods and add-ons now
2018-10-03 15:03:18	adamd	Has anyone ever suggested you may have too much time on your hands?  It gets suggested to me frequently.
2018-10-03 15:03:34	adamd	Usually when I am working on a retro computer project.
2018-10-03 15:03:44	@demure	Welp, right now I certainly do not have too much time
2018-10-03 15:04:12	adamd	I did mod a nerf gun once. It was a battery operated machine gun. I connected a variable supply and upped the voltage until it broke.  Darts went like hell though.
2018-10-03 15:04:21	kirch	most of my projects are because I have too much time on my hands
2018-10-03 15:04:33	kirch	mixed with a bit of "Protestant Work Ethic"
2018-10-03 15:04:40	@demure	I believe that "you have too much time" normally means "I don't understand your interest" or "I cant understand the value in that"
2018-10-03 15:04:42	adamd	kirch.. true.  I like having extra time.

2018-10-04 17:30:20	@jmz	figured so, was just curious. I do love the thinkpad keyboards lol. i'm debating selling my current 12" MacBook, I really want to start getting out of debt aggressively and I could get ~$900 for this and just use an old desktop or laptop I have around the house
2018-10-04 17:31:55	@demure	You can pick up cheap corporate referb thinkpads ^_- 
2018-10-04 17:33:52	@jmz	yeah i probably would eventually, I have an x220 laying around for my fiance but she doesn't use it much. my needs are pretty basic. if I sold the MacBook for $900 I could still walk away with $700 after buying a thinkpad lol. 
2018-10-04 17:34:24	@jmz	but since I have devices already it'd make more sense to use them and pay off some shit.

2018-10-04 17:44:43	@spk	would recommend the ex-corporate route though - most consumer-grade hardware is crap
2018-10-04 17:47:06	njsg	I can confirm this for HP
2018-10-04 17:47:50	njsg	(Not that the wifi module is any better on at least some professional-grade models)
2018-10-04 17:48:14	@spk	no, but at least they're usually slightly better put together
2018-10-04 17:51:00	njsg	A lot of laptops are not really well designed
2018-10-04 17:51:05	njsg	it's not like they wanted to make it small
2018-10-04 17:51:48	njsg	but more like they wanted to use that as an excuse for doing some things that are not so good
2018-10-04 17:52:13	njsg	for example, lack of ventilation and heat dissipation
2018-10-04 17:56:08	njsg	It turns out that booting linux directly changes things.
2018-10-04 17:56:25	njsg	The card doesn't work yet, but now the right module is autoloaded.
2018-10-04 18:00:06	@jmz	yeah I know what you mean, i've seen a lot of shitty consumer hardware but maybe i'm particularly lucky or just baby my stuff, only hardware I've had fail is a PSU. *knocks on wood*
2018-10-04 18:03:13	@spk	hehe
2018-10-04 18:03:54	@spk	I'm not sure the internals are mush better just the cases a bit more robust. They know that if stuff breaks too much corporates will get pissed off
2018-10-04 18:05:05	@jmz	makes sense yeah. MacBooks are nice but its kinda crazy how they can't be repaired, even by Apple. most repairs Ive read about require replacing either the top case or bottom, basicallyl the whole damn thing...
2018-10-04 18:05:50	njsg	And that's not a new trend
2018-10-04 18:06:36	njsg	At one point, I was checking how easy/hard it'd be to upgrade the HDD in a PowerBook G4 (I needed to speed up gentoo compilations somehow, you see)

2018-10-04 20:57:17	@rcf	I only miss flash in the sense that I would miss weekday afternoon binge drinking as a student: some fun times were had, but it was always something of a risky proposition, and even the thought of revisiting it now is rather nauseating.

2018-10-05 06:26:45	+robertm	njsg, I agree.  In the post-Flash era I encounter lots of aggressive garbage (animations, videos that start themselves) that I almost never encountered during the Flash era, because I just didn't install the plugin.

2018-10-08 07:49:42	@mlaine	they are in the LAS format
2018-10-08 07:50:07	@mlaine	and yes, one file per sample, at most a few hundred kbs each

2018-10-08 08:09:34	@mlaine	ah, now i'm running it on my laptop
2018-10-08 08:10:04	@mlaine	but once i get my code together, we'll move it to AWS
2018-10-08 08:10:21	@mlaine	so that we can test it with gpus
2018-10-08 08:13:42	@mlaine	my previous hack was done using sklearn
2018-10-08 08:13:56	@mlaine	and it's not very good for production
2018-10-08 08:16:47	@mlaine	(re-training is slow)
2018-10-08 08:26:27	@spk	ah right, I guess most people run these jobs on an appropriate GPU from a cloud vendor rather than invest in hardware
2018-10-08 08:27:08	@mlaine	yeah, we don't most of the time need such hw
2018-10-08 08:27:29	@mlaine	we have only one local server here

2018-10-08 09:45:48	%koenig	mlaine: If you find some great TensorFlow materials online and wouldn't mind linking me to them, I'd appreciate that.
2018-10-08 09:47:29	@mlaine	honestly, the hardest part in trying to grok tensorflow is finding decent and consistent tutorials/docs
2018-10-08 09:48:29	@mlaine	their webpage is awful imo
2018-10-08 09:56:34	%koenig	That's why I asked for links to anything great that you find.
2018-10-08 09:57:12	%koenig	I've been building some simple models using scikit-learn and have data for a few different use cases.  So I could probably try that data with TensorFlow and see what kind of experience I get.
2018-10-08 09:57:23	%koenig	You know, in all of my free time.  :)
2018-10-08 09:57:50	%koenig	But seriously, I'm probably set up as well as I ever will be to mess around with TensorFlow and see if I can use it effectively, so why not.
2018-10-08 10:01:08	@mlaine	yeah, i'll notify you should i find something
2018-10-08 10:01:38	@mlaine	this is the best i found thus far: https://cs230-stanford.github.io/tensorflow-getting-started.html
2018-10-08 10:02:25	@mlaine	it's not much, but got me started

2018-10-08 10:47:32	%koenig	Thanks for the link.
2018-10-08 11:19:25	@spk	koenig: there's some example models in their github repo: https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official
2018-10-08 11:20:09	@spk	heavily linked to the Cloud TPU service though
2018-10-08 11:20:32	%koenig	Yeah, I messed with those a bit when I was doing the Google Cloud Certification stuff.
2018-10-08 11:21:10	%koenig	The difficulty I had with those was that they were more cookbook.  "First do this.  Next do this.  Next do this.  Now you have a running model."
2018-10-08 11:21:31	%koenig	I felt like I would have to probably spend more time reading between the lines to understand what exactly was happening there.
2018-10-08 11:21:39	%koenig	Although I appreciate the link to them.
2018-10-08 11:22:00	@spk	ah right, I wasn't sure how far you had got at all :)
2018-10-08 11:22:12	%koenig	Maybe it wasn't those specific examples that I previously looked at.  I can't completely recall.  I actually have my notes sitting nearby.
2018-10-08 11:22:21	@spk	How did you find the cloud certification?
2018-10-08 11:22:52	%koenig	Well, I'll be able to tell you very soon how useful it is because I'm on a project for work that uses the materials directly.  :)
2018-10-08 11:23:16	%koenig	I went in with a pretty decent background in cloud architecture and also data engineering/science, so the coursework wasn't so difficult.
2018-10-08 11:23:28	%koenig	I studied for a couple weeks for each of the two exams and passed pretty easily.
2018-10-08 11:23:57	%koenig	But in my opinion there's a pretty decent gap between passing the exams and actually having useful knowledge that you can leverage to do real solutions.
2018-10-08 11:24:17	%koenig	It probably sets you up enough that you could get a job doing it with some hand-holding, and then those jobs are where you're really going to learn everything of course.
2018-10-08 11:25:55	@spk	yeah, as ever
2018-10-08 11:26:48	%koenig	Frankly, that's the best reason for being a consultant right there.
2018-10-08 11:26:48	@spk	I am more sat in the position of managing the infrastructure and not a data scientist
2018-10-08 11:26:48	%koenig	As a consultant, you get to go in and turn the screwdrivers on a lot of projects quickly.
2018-10-08 11:27:51	⚡	koenig nods.
2018-10-08 11:27:59	%koenig	My company keeps switching me from various types of data scientist type projects to various types of cloud architecture type projects.
2018-10-08 11:28:11	%koenig	It's nice because I don't get pinned into just one thing, but it's a lot of work.

2018-10-08 12:10:25	%koenig	Nah, not necessarily.
2018-10-08 12:10:49	%koenig	You learn more by doing a hands-on approach than school is likely to teach you.  Although I do think school offers other things that are highly useful in building a career.

2018-10-08 12:21:08	%koenig	Well, like I say, get some certifications and use those to get the money flow going.  Then decide whether a university degree is worthwhile.
2018-10-08 12:22:02	gl1tch	Good thought.  I am working on getting my A+ cert and I am working on getting started in a Java cert program
2018-10-08 12:22:35	@demure	gl1tch: a suggestion for making your self marketable: find projects that amuse you (setting up a home LAN, etc), do them (and document while in progress), then make blog posts with a write up.

2018-10-08 13:53:31	%koenig	Yeah.  My girlfriend and I have OTA television and I notice that.  I guess you have to buffer enough of the channel stream to display it.
2018-10-08 13:53:47	@demure	welp, if we forced cable companies to have standards on their box tops, and forced them to allow third party box tops, this would be fixed

2018-10-08 15:26:42	%koenig	Hi fmoonII!
2018-10-08 15:31:49	@fmoonII	:)
2018-10-08 15:39:45	njsg	koenig: indeed. I'm (finally) setting up the VCR (it had not been connected to the RF antenna for a long time), and the first thing I noticed was that
2018-10-08 15:40:11	⚡	njsg wants to do some time shifting
2018-10-08 15:40:41	%koenig	My most superior television setup ever was Windows Media Center with a HDHomerun network-connected tuner.
2018-10-08 15:40:56	%koenig	You could program WMC to record anything on OTA television.
2018-10-08 15:41:01	%koenig	Then skip all the commercials.
2018-10-08 15:41:17	%koenig	I keep thinking I will set up MythTV with the HDHomerun, but then I never get around to doing it.
2018-10-08 15:41:57	njsg	demure: in Portugal, I'd say the move to digital TV killed OTA TV (poorly done, very bad reception compared to analog (a great problem, given how digital signals don't degrade nicely...))
2018-10-08 15:43:07	njsg	In the end, it was a fiasco, a shame nobody tried to revert it, more features this, more features that, more channels, it ended up having the same four/five channels that had been airing for years in analog TV.
2018-10-08 15:44:45	njsg	nowadays, the situation has improved a bit, but cable companies probably saw their market share increase significantly
2018-10-08 15:45:19	njsg	Now the interesting bit: there are cable TVs doing analog+digital cable, no box needed.
2018-10-08 15:46:21	njsg	There's one that does PAL and DVB-T, and another that does PAL and DVB-C. I don't know about the others (there's at least 3 big TV+ISP companies)
2018-10-08 15:47:01	njsg	But I suppose they could force people to use boxes if they wanted, it's good they at least have that.
2018-10-08 15:48:38	njsg	koenig: I used to see TV in the desktop, back then it was analog TV. I did record stuff a few times, by dumping the mpeg stream from the video tuner.
2018-10-08 15:49:03	njsg	s.video tuner.TV tuner.
2018-10-08 15:49:45	%koenig	I watched the most television when I had that setup.  I could stream the recorded video onto my laptop in bed or on the couch if I wanted.  It was very convenient.
2018-10-08 15:49:52	njsg	I could do a bit more now that there's DVB, the card does DVB-T too
2018-10-08 15:50:23	njsg	But I would have to wrestle the package manager. I think most of the packages I had installed to watch TV were removed from Gentoo

2018-10-08 17:32:00	adamd	Not sure its something I need to worry about.  Just wanted to ask them.
2018-10-08 17:32:08	%koenig	The bus tours run through the museum, and as they are moving right now they may be haphazard.

2018-10-08 17:32:26	%koenig	The biggest issue is that you need to be US citizens, which I assume is not an issue.
2018-10-08 17:32:28	adamd	I likely don't need to worry anyhow.
2018-10-08 17:32:44	adamd	It would just suck to get there and have full busses.  Yes I am a US citizen.

2018-10-08 17:33:04	%koenig	Ok, then it should be okay.
2018-10-08 17:33:38	adamd	We're looking forward to meeting you and Teri also.  Perhaps if we plan it correct we can take in a Wasabi show together some night at the hotel bar or something.

Even if "john" was available "johndoe" was available it would not let you choose either and will force you to check a fixed username (for vanity url) as "JohnDoe__ __" add at least two characters at the end.
2018-10-08 23:48:33	@rcf	And then "Oh, you have an unusual name and tried to use google+? Let us lock out your whole google account until you send us government ID."

2018-10-09 05:14:20	njsg	Google+'s biggest fault might well be how they tried to force it everywhere

2018-10-09 05:25:18	njsg	If I could find such a physical store for electronics here or a place where big companies dump their "old" electronics, that'd be good. There must be something, I just need to look harder...
2018-10-09 05:26:04	@rcf	In my case I got a fairly nice JVC SVHS deck with built-in TBC for $12 at a local goodwill.

2018-10-09 05:31:21	@rcf	Makes some sense, I suppose. Bulky, and less useful for the average consumer.
2018-10-09 05:31:52	njsg	odie: Finland?
2018-10-09 05:33:21	njsg	rcf: It depends on the price of storage space, I guess. If it isn't expensive, and it isn't already filled with CRTs and VCRs, there's no good reason not to accept these, now if it is expensive to store...
2018-10-09 05:34:48	@rcf	njsg: that's been the issue I think. Lots of existing inventory that moves a lot more slowly, while proper disposal of old electronics that can't be sold is more expensive.
2018-10-09 05:36:15	@odie	njsg: Germany
2018-10-09 05:55:57	njsg	odie: ah, it's that there was a similar move in Finland somewhat recently
2018-10-09 05:58:03	njsg	recycling centers there stopped accepting at least VHS tapes. That's the only thing I'm sure about, I need to find the news article again to see if they are now refusing VCRs too.
2018-10-09 05:58:14	njsg	This would be much easier if gmane were up

2018-10-09 10:33:01	@elw	Ugh, finally had to remove my SDF email account from K9 Mail. I couldn't figure out how to tell K9 to stop syncing email and all it was doing was producing cert errors.
2018-10-09 10:33:09	@elw	Hope someone fixes that soon.
2018-10-09 10:39:29	%koenig	I honestly kind of doubt this is going to get fixed.
2018-10-09 10:40:03	%koenig	The problem is that there are now multiple issues going on.
2018-10-09 10:40:07	@elw	What makes you say that? It looks like just a cert chain issue (at least on the surface).
2018-10-09 10:40:22	@elw	Oh, there's more issues with mail than just that one now?
2018-10-09 10:40:23	%koenig	For just the certificate issue, sure, no problem.
2018-10-09 10:40:40	%koenig	But there are also issues with mail in general that people are posing on BBOARD.
2018-10-09 10:41:09	%koenig	Anyway, the issue with certificates is that the LetsEncrypt model is to have certificates expire frequently, so the expectation is that you'll automate the process of renewal.
2018-10-09 10:41:17	%koenig	But that doesn't seem to have happened here.
2018-10-09 10:41:58	%koenig	And I'm not positive it will be that easy given how they're rolled out.  There was this process undertaken to get all of MetaARPA people a LetsEncrypt certificate in some rolling application process.
2018-10-09 10:42:14	%koenig	So then when all of those expire, you'd have to repeat that process, again in a rolling request basis.
2018-10-09 10:42:21	%koenig	I just don't know if it scales.
2018-10-09 10:42:32	%koenig	Anyway, maybe I'm just dumb and don't know what I'm talking about.
2018-10-09 10:44:56	@elw	Haha, I just saw the HURTDESK post.

2018-10-09 11:36:36	@demure	I see two possible issues with LE for mail
2018-10-09 11:36:48	@demure	1) don't set it to update every month @#$%^&*(
2018-10-09 11:37:05	@demure	2) add post update hooks to restart the service (imap/etc)
2018-10-09 11:37:27	@demure	If the key changes again next month I'm going to rant on the bboard
2018-10-09 11:41:06	%koenig	Well, of course it's going to.
2018-10-09 11:41:26	%koenig	And that was the point of what I was talking about on HURTDESK.  (Which admittedly isn't the proper forum for my post.)
2018-10-09 11:42:38	%koenig	Figure out collectively as a community where the disconnect is between what is wanted (e.g., LetsEncrypt certs that get updated in a timely way with services that are properly restarted) and how it has to be done by people with privileges to do it (e.g., post update hook to restart services).
2018-10-09 11:43:03	%koenig	But I don't ever see anything come out of any of this that suggests to me it's ever going to be different.
2018-10-09 11:43:18	%koenig	And I'm okay with that, as I have been okay with that since I came to SDF in 2005.
2018-10-09 11:43:31	%koenig	It's just that I'm only willing to engage with SDF to a certain extent if that's how SDF works.
2018-10-09 11:43:38	%koenig	And that's okay too.

2018-10-09 12:18:06	amar	Hi @demure, is there a SDF mailing list - pub or private where users can join - an alternative to bboard that doesn't require accessing it from the shell? Saw the .._admins.txt link and looks like something from a mailing list. Is it admin only?
2018-10-09 12:20:34	@demure	there is no real 'alternative' to the bboard, is you want to post you use the bboard. some people has suggested there is a read only newsgroup of the bboard. 
2018-10-09 12:20:44	@demure	the link came from the bboard

2018-10-09 12:30:23	amar	Oh. Also I quickly found it (again) https://sdf.org/?faq?CHAT?03 and this pretty much sums things up. Yes, I have been regular on bboard for fast few weeks. Guess I will develop a habit soon and hope to participate for more than ranting :P
2018-10-09 12:49:29	%koenig	Well, more that my workflow is to treat SDF e-mail as a thing I use to talk to other people hanging out in the "clubhouse" and nothing beyond that.
2018-10-09 12:49:40	%koenig	For various reasons, including the certificate situation, I wouldn't use it beyond that.
2018-10-09 12:49:58	%koenig	And I access it only via mutt on the cluster, which seems to be the best way to go after it.

2018-10-10 11:43:52	@benharri	ok cool
2018-10-10 11:48:36	njsg	It just happens that in the linux systems I deal with, high load averages usually go hand in hand with heavy I/O
2018-10-10 11:48:39	njsg	"Your CPU is too fast for this hard disk"
2018-10-10 12:05:25	%koenig	It also depends on the type of I/O, of course.
2018-10-10 12:05:56	%koenig	If the I/O interrupts the CPU for servicing vs. if the I/O uses Direct Memory Access to read/write memory without interrupting the CPU.
2018-10-10 12:06:13	%koenig	Although overall, yes, the loadavg is running CPU processes that are doing computing work.

2018-10-10 22:56:53	@snowdusk	it's just chemicals really
2018-10-10 22:56:59	zcrayfish	Delicious chemicals
2018-10-10 22:57:03	@snowdusk	true!
2018-10-10 22:57:15	tomasino	mt dew forms itself from ambient eldritch energies
2018-10-10 22:57:21	tomasino	there's no company behind it

2018-10-10 23:00:58	zcrayfish	hm... another hurricane coming tomorrow here in NC
2018-10-10 23:01:11	zcrayfish	last time we had two back-to-back, a bunch of short-leaf pine trees toppled.
2018-10-10 23:01:33	@snowdusk	yikes. be careful zcrayfish . Do you get floods?
2018-10-10 23:01:51	zcrayfish	I'm on high ground, so all good here.
2018-10-10 23:02:08	zcrayfish	and my pine tree is under 30 feet, so I think it will be ok
2018-10-10 23:02:16	@snowdusk	very good. Not so good for ppl living in basements tho
2018-10-10 23:02:33	zcrayfish	However the ones closer to the road... I would not be surprised if they knock out the power lines. :\
2018-10-10 23:02:45	zcrayfish	they're closer to 100 ft tall
2018-10-10 23:02:59	@snowdusk	that is scary. I still have a bit of fear walking under powerlines LOL 
2018-10-10 23:03:19	@snowdusk	so i cannot imagine hurricane and powerlines

2018-10-10 23:03:33	zcrayfish	I hung the temporary phone line at my grandma's house from the neutral power line................. LOL
2018-10-10 23:03:58	zcrayfish	so she could cut grass without running it over while waiting for the telco to bury a permanent line
2018-10-10 23:04:11	@snowdusk	i live in an area where there are no powerlines ... i live in a newer area of the city and so powerlines are underground
2018-10-10 23:04:20	zcrayfish	cool.
2018-10-10 23:04:25	tomasino	so much smarter
2018-10-10 23:04:29	zcrayfish	Depends.
2018-10-10 23:04:33	tomasino	we just have massive power outtages every winter
2018-10-10 23:04:39	zcrayfish	underground power service gets hit by lightening a lot more.

2018-10-10 23:05:59	zcrayfish	in larger cities that have utility tunnels, it's not so bad though, because they are still accessible
2018-10-10 23:06:02	@snowdusk	for us up here in toronto, we fear icestorms... they freeze the powerlines and disable them
2018-10-10 23:06:18	@benharri	oh you're in toronto snowdusk ?

2018-10-11 09:39:44	%koenig	mlaine: I have a bunch of Oil & Gas industry data (proprietary) that I can use to train models, so now I mostly just need time to do it.
2018-10-11 09:40:35	%koenig	This is a "skunkworks" project, so I work on it in my spare time which is getting stretched pretty thin these days.

2018-10-11 14:09:05	⚡	niro is in the middle of "status bars" during his maintenance window.
2018-10-11 14:09:12	%koenig	I've been working on a new engagement project for ~2 weeks that has turned out to open more doors than the past ~2 years in the data & analytics practice I'm assigned to.
2018-10-11 14:09:55	%koenig	I recommend listening to R.E.M.  Our friend snowdusk played some R.E.M. on his show the other night and it reminded me of how great they are.
2018-10-11 14:10:17	@niro	koenig: whoa, that's great! Congratulations. Can you talk about your project at all?
2018-10-11 14:10:44	%koenig	It's a cloud architecture project, building a Google Cloud Platform architecture for a company.
2018-10-11 14:11:07	%koenig	But the idea is to build a general architecture that we can take into an entire industry.
2018-10-11 14:11:52	%koenig	So that directly is great for me, but there's also an indirect benefit (I think).  Namely, I'm a data scientist.  One of the challenges of being a data scientist here is finding good sources of data to pitch projects against.
2018-10-11 14:12:17	%koenig	So you'll pitch to some industry and spend a few months only to find out that the company you've been talking to has shit data.
2018-10-11 14:12:30	%koenig	But with my approach, I actually get to put my hands on their data at the beginning before I commit.
2018-10-11 14:12:44	%koenig	So if I have models ready to go, I can pitch to them as an extension of a project, which I think might be easier.
2018-10-11 14:12:48	%koenig	Dunno.
2018-10-11 14:13:34	@ecelis	the cluster was restored from a backup?

2018-10-11 18:36:26	njsg	... is there any case where printenv would know some variable that is not present in the environment of a shell script, when the script has not touched that variable?
2018-10-11 18:38:03	njsg	To quote two lines of this script: PPDC=`printenv | grep "PPD="`  ;   PPDC=`echo $PPDC | sed -e 's/PPD=//'`
2018-10-11 18:38:18	njsg	I guess another concern is that printenv appears to take the variable name as a parameter
2018-10-11 18:39:03	njsg	Unless their goal *is* to take anything that ends in PPD

2018-10-12 09:38:47	%koenig	Yay Friday!!
2018-10-12 09:38:59	%koenig	And it is turning out to be a great Friday for me indeed.
2018-10-12 09:39:16	%koenig	I got one of my Oil & Gas projects funded, so that work will begin sometime in the next few months.
2018-10-12 09:39:48	%koenig	And I got a paper accepted into one of the workshops at Supercomputing 18 (coming up in Dallas, Texas, USA in November).
2018-10-12 09:40:06	%koenig	And several of us are going out for beers after work today, so that's the best part!!
2018-10-12 09:40:30	%koenig	Congratulations on the ladyfriend, mlaine.  She sounds very nice!

2018-10-12 11:34:24	%koenig	Your weekend is beginning.
2018-10-12 11:38:14	@mlaine	so it is :P
2018-10-12 11:38:35	@mlaine	how's you koenig?
2018-10-12 11:38:43	@mlaine	at work?
2018-10-12 11:41:30	%koenig	Yeah.  It is 11:40 a.m. here, so I'm just about to the point where I will go with people from my office to have tacos for lunch.
2018-10-12 11:41:46	%koenig	I got this thing started in my office where we try to go out to tacos on Fridays.
2018-10-12 11:42:14	%koenig	And then after work today my girlfriend and I are meeting people from the Lab I used to work at for beers.  So that'll be great fun.
2018-10-12 11:42:21	@mlaine	ah, well, bon appetit
2018-10-12 11:42:26	%koenig	:)  Thanks!
2018-10-12 11:42:56	%koenig	There was a hurricane that hit the southern United States a couple days ago, so the weather here was a little rainy yesterday and is quite a bit colder today.
2018-10-12 11:43:00	%koenig	!ow knoxville
2018-10-12 11:43:01	&BASHy2	Weather for Knoxville, US: 12.52 C, 64% humidity, scattered clouds, 2.1 m/s wind
2018-10-12 11:43:15	%koenig	But it's very pleasant.
2018-10-12 11:46:32	@mlaine	doesn't sound too bad
2018-10-12 11:47:41	%koenig	My girlfriend likes it to be cool, so she wants to run air conditioning a lot.  We finally turned that off and opened a window last night and it felt awesome.
2018-10-12 11:48:35	@mlaine	yeah, ac'd air tends to be rather dry
2018-10-12 11:49:14	@mlaine	or do you have a humidifier of some sort?
2018-10-12 11:49:50	%koenig	Nope.  Although where I live it is often quite humid so it doesn't seem to be a big problem.
2018-10-12 11:50:19	%koenig	On the other hand, the heat in winter dries my skin out a lot.  I have to use body lotion to keep from feeing terrible.

2018-10-12 23:00:07	tomasino	gotcha. I believe the normal response time on emails is 3-5 days, but it's all based on what's going on with the admins and we never really have insight into that
2018-10-12 23:00:23	lneely	not too important, i can access my mail from shell.  just would be convenient to send via mx from my local box.
2018-10-12 23:00:26	tomasino	when smj was doing it solo, I'd look at his activity on mastodon to see if he was traveling. That usually meant a longer delay
2018-10-12 23:00:37	lneely	ahh, but didn't iczer take back over?
2018-10-12 23:00:50	tomasino	he did, and theres other helpers too now, but I don't know them
2018-10-12 23:00:57	lneely	right on
2018-10-12 23:01:07	tomasino	you're doing the right stuff, so I'd assume it'll get addressed in the next couple days. If not, bump on bboard or follow up on email again
2018-10-12 23:01:13	lneely	thanks tomasino :)

2018-10-15 16:11:31	%koenig	I mostly need the VPS so I have a stable inward-bound point on the Internet.
2018-10-15 16:11:40	@demure	*nod*
2018-10-15 16:12:28	@demure	one of these days I should set up a point 2 point vpn/etc from my pfsense to my vps (not for routing normal outbound traffic)
2018-10-15 16:12:42	njsg	I was mostly satisfied when all I had was 1/3 GHz, if anything I'm not satisfied with software that tends to grow so large that it negates the benefits of faster and newer hardware...
2018-10-15 16:13:48	%koenig	demure: I have an OpenVPN tunnel that "one of these days" I'm going to use to redirect inbound e-mail through the VPS into my server.
2018-10-15 16:14:20	%koenig	The advantage of having e-mail come into the VPS is if the server suffers some kind of hardware failure my e-mail continues to function.
2018-10-15 16:14:43	%koenig	The real way to do it would be to have the primary MX be the VPN tunnel and the secondary MX be the VPS itself.

2018-10-17 10:18:21	@mlaine	not sure, prolly medium since i hear the japanese nibs are on the thin side
2018-10-17 10:18:33	@mlaine	and i don't like very thin
2018-10-17 10:18:41	@mlaine	my pelikan is a medium as well
2018-10-17 10:19:20	@jkrueger	Sounds good for you, medium then.
2018-10-17 10:19:39	@mlaine	:)
2018-10-17 10:21:15	@jkrueger	I had always liked larger nibs and stubs, now I'm in love with a custome needlepoint. :)
2018-10-17 10:21:43	@mlaine	i wrote a letter last week
2018-10-17 10:21:56	@mlaine	and plan to write another one today or tomorrow :)
2018-10-17 10:23:27	@jkrueger	Great, I have a list of letters to write, I'm lazy I guess.
2018-10-17 10:24:50	@jkrueger	I'm working on a manuscript with drawings right now, it seems to occupy me fully.
2018-10-17 10:26:21	@mlaine	sounds lovely though :)
2018-10-17 10:27:15	@jkrueger	All pen and  ink, to be  offered as one of a kind, not to be mass published.

2018-10-17 10:36:08	jcrawford	my handwriting is a disaster so I insist on very small nibs.
2018-10-17 10:36:26	jcrawford	Lamy makes a very good EF nib considering the price, best I've used so far in a <$100 pen.
2018-10-17 10:37:30	jcrawford	it used to be kind of hard to buy but I think they just list them online now. mine I emailed them to ask about because I Heard a Rumor that they had EF nibs that they weren't selling ;)

2018-10-17 13:18:33	@demure	njsg: are you using mpv?
2018-10-17 13:18:43	njsg	no, mplayer
2018-10-17 13:19:04	@demure	Try mpv? Mplayer < mplayer2 < mpv
2018-10-17 13:19:42		amar has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
2018-10-17 13:19:47	njsg	I got fed up with how mpv did big changes in the interface and behaviour, and with the attitude of some people from their community, so I switched back to mplayer
2018-10-17 13:20:17	njsg	There's also the question that mplayer has several things like I want by default, in mpv, if those are possible, I'll have to change them by hand. But shouldn't be impossible
2018-10-17 13:20:18	@demure	Kk
2018-10-17 13:20:24	njsg	I'll first try to see if I can fix this with mplayer
2018-10-17 13:20:53	njsg	If it turns out there's really a big mess somewhere that can't be fixed, I'll give mpv a try.
2018-10-17 13:21:29	njsg	so far, I'm trying to upgrade libvpx
2018-10-17 13:23:06	njsg	Improves playback a lot in ffplay and vlc (still not good, though), mplayer is... lagging behind
2018-10-17 13:26:03	@demure	is mplayer even still maintained? >_>
2018-10-17 13:27:15	njsg	I suppose so
2018-10-17 13:29:21	@demure	last blog post from mplayer's site http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html
2018-10-17 13:29:38	@demure	(is telling people about mpv)
2018-10-17 13:29:48	njsg	last release seems to be from 2016, although that doesn't mean a lot
2018-10-17 13:30:07	njsg	last entry is about mpv because copyright
2018-10-17 13:30:20	@demure	I guess there is still some activity in their svn
2018-10-17 13:30:23	@demure	(boo svn)
2018-10-17 13:30:34	njsg	oh, they do say "This is just our project trying to help MPV project get some attention. "

2018-10-17 13:37:33	@mlaine	any idea what's that about?
2018-10-17 13:37:59	njsg	It might also be that VP9 is simply too new and CPU-intensive by design. It at least seems to have support for several CPU features my CPU doesn't have.
2018-10-17 13:40:46	@demure	I'm hoping it's as simple as something broken in the administration scripts

2018-10-17 16:39:40	@billinja	Any experienced SysAdmins out there that want to throw some luck my way, I'd appreciate it.  Installing FreeBSD for the first time to replace my CentOS server and I'm on attempt #2 lol.  Hopefully I've figured out what went wrong the first time :S
2018-10-17 16:45:12	@demure	billinja: do you have specific area's you wish info on? 
2018-10-17 16:46:34	@billinja	No, not as yet - but thank you.  Just looking for some well wishes for now :D
2018-10-17 16:46:56	%koenig	Good luck and well wishes!
2018-10-17 16:47:06	%koenig	I've run FreeBSD as a server for probably around 23 years.
2018-10-17 16:47:16	@billinja	I think the problem was that I attempted to partition a seperate hard drive for /home using ZFS.  When I re-installed, without using ZFS the install appears to be fine.
2018-10-17 16:47:22	%koenig	I think it's great.  If I'm around and you get stuck, feel free to hit me up.
2018-10-17 16:47:41	%koenig	Yeah, if you have a single hard drive ZFS isn't as useful.
2018-10-17 16:47:42	@billinja	Thanks!  Much appreciated.  So far I've been able to boot, and I'm on the network.  I'd call that a win so far lol
2018-10-17 16:47:48	%koenig	Yep.
2018-10-17 16:48:01	%koenig	Were you the person asking on BBOARD about FreeBSD a few days ago?
2018-10-17 16:48:09	@billinja	I've got multiple hard drives.  Using 1x for boot, 1x for /home, and then I have a few to set up some volgroups for storage.
2018-10-17 16:48:16	@billinja	Yep, that was me :)
2018-10-17 16:48:24	%koenig	Ok, good deal.
2018-10-17 16:48:56	@billinja	I replied in bboard a short while ago, but decided to take the plunge this evening.
2018-10-17 16:49:24	%koenig	If I were you, most likely I'd just try to duplicate the things you're getting on your CentOS machine.
2018-10-17 16:49:31	%koenig	You'll learn a lot doing that.
2018-10-17 16:49:45	%koenig	And if you don't have a specific goal in mind, that's probably as good as any goal.
2018-10-17 16:50:16	@billinja	That's exactly what I decided to do.  I fully committed, because I blew away my centos so there's no going back now :D
2018-10-17 16:50:55	@billinja	It wasn't much.  BIND, Webmin, Samba and Nextcloud.
2018-10-17 16:52:21	%koenig	All of those should be straightforward.
2018-10-17 16:52:45	%koenig	I haven't done Nextcloud on FreeBSD, but have done the others (although not recently with BIND and Webmin, I'm afraid).

2018-10-18 09:46:19	njsg	wayne1: ah, I was hoping such a thing would make it easier to have that guy discuss computer history *and* politics at the same time
2018-10-18 09:47:10	njsg	At least computer history isn't software development, the latter can get even more political than politics... (IMHO)
2018-10-18 09:47:14	wayne1	maybe a couple weeks ago the /.history file for some rooms had bad permissions, we fixed it by [y]anking ppl out of room and letting it regenerate...

2018-10-18 09:47:51	njsg	I hope there's no disk going bad or some filesystem bug at SDF

2018-10-18 09:49:17	njsg	Yeah, it's just that a permissions problem with com, together with problems with some new accounts... 
2018-10-18 09:49:40	wayne1	it was probably something wrong with commode.ksh or one of the programs it uses... not the filesystem itself
2018-10-18 09:49:53	@rcf	njsg: the one major issue is that the changing nature of acceleration means older hardware is little more than a dumb frame buffer, but that’s also an advantage if you can expose fbdev or drm interfaces from the kernel — fbdev/modesetting are already written for you.
2018-10-18 09:51:50	njsg	koenig: (but of course RAID 5 rules out disk issues, indeed)
2018-10-18 09:52:23	@elw	Anyone here using weechat on ma as an irc bouncer?
2018-10-18 09:52:37	@rcf	elw: yes.
2018-10-18 09:52:42	@elw	I've got it working without ssl but I can't get ssl working
2018-10-18 09:52:52	@elw	always tls handshake errors
2018-10-18 09:52:53	wayne1	actually, i get broken lines on [rR]eview and [I]dle ever since [i]gnoring someone...
2018-10-18 09:53:09	njsg	rcf: The biggest problem will be indeed learning more about the driver architecture and what exactly would I need to do. It would be an interesting project, though.
2018-10-18 09:53:54	@elw	rcf: Do you have it working with ssl? If so, could you share the non-sensitive bits of your relay.conf with me?

2018-10-18 10:09:20	@elw	rcf: Are you using it as an irc relay or a weechat relay? I think those things might be slightly different.
2018-10-18 10:09:36	@rcf	Ah. Weechat relay only. 
2018-10-18 10:10:19	@elw	I wish there was a way to connect weechat to weechat using the weechat protocol instead of having to setup individual irc relays
2018-10-18 10:10:59	@elw	It seems like something that would be supported, and probably does, I just haven't seen docs on it
2018-10-18 10:11:29	@rcf	It's on my list of things I'll probably never get around to but would like, along with unix domain socket listening. 
2018-10-18 10:12:52	@rcf	Running in tmux is enough for me, really. With mosh, if the connection is bad. 
2018-10-18 10:15:46	@rcf	Apparently somebody's actually working on it maybe: https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/369
2018-10-18 10:23:30	@elw	Yeah, I was just looking at that issue
2018-10-18 10:24:11	@elw	My use case, unfortunately, requires that I use a local client. I connect to multiple relay instances on a few different shells and I connected from the local client to slack using wee_slack.py
2018-10-18 10:24:31	@elw	I'm conencted over ssh to ma.sdf.org in screen at the moment, though

2018-10-18 13:20:39	@billinja	Thanks for all the comments on Free vs Open BSD.  I'm still no closer to understanding the use-case for each.  Sounds like they're largely interchangeable, and ultimately it comes down to the bits and bobs that the "teams" focus on (security vs. performance vs. open-sourceableness). :)  Either way, my FreeBSD is up and running - and I can't think of any reason why (yet) I'd want to go back to Linux
2018-10-18 13:20:40	@billinja	from a server perspective.
2018-10-18 13:22:43	%koenig	More or less it's the philosophy behind the individual operating systems.
2018-10-18 13:22:58	%koenig	There's a lot of cross-sharing of ideas, too.
2018-10-18 13:24:02	%koenig	The FreeBSD guys, in my opinion, have a sort of mixture between the Linux philosophy of blasting forward very fast and incorporating lots of ideas vs. the OpenBSD philosophy of having a very circumscribed agenda and focusing mainly on "correctness".
2018-10-18 13:24:14	%koenig	(Where "correctness" often means "security" but doesn't have to.)
2018-10-18 13:25:02	%koenig	FreeBSD gets pretty good performance, often fairly comparable to Linux.  Occasionally FreeBSD outperforms Linux, especially on network-oriented benchmarks.  More often Linux outperforms FreeBSD by a bit.
2018-10-18 13:25:14	%koenig	Typically with modern hardware it's not a huge difference.
2018-10-18 13:25:52	%koenig	OpenBSD tends to have less performance by a noticable margin, but it is a more simplistic design because it's aiming for correctness.
2018-10-18 13:26:33	%koenig	Plus, the primary owner of the OpenBSD project (Theo) has his own unique mindset and hears his own drummer that he marches to.  So OpenBSD doesn't really answer to many of the things that drive Linux.
2018-10-18 13:27:30	%koenig	My opinion about OpenBSD is that if they could (1) get their SMT support more performant, and (2) get their virtulizer (called "VMM") more updated, it'd be a lot more appealing to me.
2018-10-18 13:27:36	%koenig	A lot of people here run OpenBSD.
2018-10-18 13:28:14	@billinja	Makes sense. In that case, I think I made the right choice - coming from Linux, to give myself a good intro to BSD.  Plus, I'm learning alot simply by trying to understand these differences.  I appreciate that you, and everyone else's opinions and thoughts.  This is probably the bets discussion I've been involved in here since I joined :D
2018-10-18 13:28:15	%koenig	I think you've made a good choice with FreeBSD.  At least give it a go for a while and see what you like and dislike about it and then re-choose in the future if you wish.
2018-10-18 13:29:16	%koenig	I'm taking time to advocate for FreeBSD because it seems like the BSDs really get downtrodden a lot lately.  OpenBSD 6.4 was released today and the article on Hacker News is not very encouraging.
2018-10-18 13:29:50	%koenig	Linux people just don't see any reason to even look at anything else anymore.  And that's too bad.  It's almost like "the unknown is bad!" mentality.
2018-10-18 13:29:51	@billinja	That's my thoughts as well.  There are already a few things I'd do slightly differently in a new install, along with a few things I still need to understand better (like jails).  All in all, I'm glad I took the plunge personally.

2018-10-18 14:23:22	@billinja	I agree.  The loss of curiosity, and wanting to simlply stick only to what you know is sad.  I started my IT career as an AS/400 Operator/SysAdmin, so maybe that's why I have a respect and preference for CLI, but I've been a Linux Admin, and Windows Admin - and run a mix of both at home at any given time just for fun.  My curiosity pushes me to learn more, which only helps me to better recommend a
2018-10-18 14:23:25	@billinja	platform based on facts, not fear of change, or fanatisicm.  Hopefully if I teach my daughter nothing else, it'll be to stay curious and keep learning lol.
2018-10-18 14:24:44	@billinja	Anyway, not sure where I was going with that lol I was typing that out earlier, and then the boss came around to go for coffee so I walked away.  Point is, I find the good in whatever I need to use.  Even Windows ;P - if it wasn't for PowerShell, I'm not sure how I would have survived :D
2018-10-18 14:25:59	%koenig	OS/400 was a pretty neat operating system.
2018-10-18 14:26:34	%koenig	I was friends with a guy who was an operator in a hospital that was an AS/400 shop.
2018-10-18 14:27:02	%koenig	I did some time as an operator in a bigger hospital in the same city that was an MVS (on a 3090) shop.
2018-10-18 14:27:51	%koenig	At my undergrad university, I used to work with an old DOS/VSE systems programmer who had the notion that if a machine wasn't large enough to kill you if it fell on you, he wasn't going to "waste" his time working on it.
2018-10-18 14:27:56	%koenig	Good times.  :)
2018-10-18 14:31:50	@billinja	lol I love that.
2018-10-18 14:33:17	@billinja	We still have a tiny footprint of /400 here, and being one of only two people that even know how the thing works, I get to get my hands dirty with it when it falls down.  It's amazing what you manage to remember even after 20 years lol
2018-10-18 14:35:31	%koenig	My first real professional job was as a VAX/VMS Systems Programmer.  More recently when people have wanted to set up "antique" VMS machines or emulators, I've somehow been able to reach into my memory and remember how to do things 25 years ago.
2018-10-18 14:35:41	%koenig	Some of that stuff just stays in your brain somewhere.
2018-10-18 14:35:47	dzho	so, Sine Nomine sponsored this year's Ohio Linux Fest, speaking of this sort of big iron
2018-10-18 14:36:14	dzho	and there was talk of running the hercules emulator
2018-10-18 14:36:28	dzho	(separate talk, not from Sine Nomine so much)
2018-10-18 14:36:58	@demure	*flop*
2018-10-18 14:37:43	%koenig	Yeah.  Linux is part of IBM's strategic vision these days (and impossible to ignore).  You can run it natively on z/Series mainframes in LPARs.  You can literally stand up thousands of Linux virtual machines on a decent size mainframe.
2018-10-18 14:38:43	@billinja	We had an iSeries with an AIX LPAR, and another with a Linux LPAR - it was a POC.  We ended up with HP-UX instead eventually, but even that's gone now.
2018-10-18 14:39:14	%koenig	Seems like there's a lot of consolidation in system software and in hardware.
2018-10-18 14:39:18	@billinja	Our ERP runs solely on Linux VMs at this point.
2018-10-18 14:39:36	dzho	demure: you ok there?

2018-10-18 14:41:52	@tidux	well thankfully for me I'm in a city where I have options, so I jump ship to a new more Linuxy job after tomorrow
2018-10-18 14:41:53	@billinja	AD *shudder*
2018-10-18 14:42:04	@tidux	my future coworkers say they haven't touched Windows in years so I remain optimistic
2018-10-18 14:42:11	@billinja	Best of luck!
2018-10-18 14:42:15	@tidux	thanks
2018-10-18 14:42:26	@tidux	back on the BSD thing, have you checked out DragonFly BSD?
2018-10-18 14:42:48	@tidux	It started as a fork of FreeBSD 4, and it's a lot faster than FreeBSD now
2018-10-18 14:42:58	@tidux	competitive with Linux on most workloads
2018-10-18 14:43:03	@billinja	I'm in Toronto.  I expect there are probably jobs out there... but I'm a 20 year veteran here, and giving up that kind of seniority would take quite a bit lol
2018-10-18 14:43:10	@tidux	oh yeah lol 
2018-10-18 14:43:21	@tidux	I'm still in my 20s so that's not really an issue for me
2018-10-18 14:43:29	@billinja	Nope, haven't heard of it, but I'll check it out.
2018-10-18 14:43:43	@tidux	https://dragonflybsd.org/ <== main site
2018-10-18 14:44:06	@billinja	I started here when I was 19
2018-10-18 14:44:10	@billinja	Thanks for the link
2018-10-18 14:45:11	@billinja	Just a note, the site didn't respond on https - seems to be http only.
2018-10-18 14:46:12	@billinja	The HAMMER filesystem sounds interesting...
2018-10-18 14:47:24	@tidux	If DragonFly ever gets single image clustering working (which was a project goal for a long time), maybe SDF will move to it.  No more "which server did I log in on" issues. :P

2018-10-18 14:59:02	@billinja	New question, still on the BSD topic - anyone running it on a laptop successfully as a Workstation/Desktop replacement?  I have a ThinkPad T420s I'd like to try it out on, but I need it to at least "mostly" work so I can still be productive :D
2018-10-18 15:03:43	%koenig	I used to run FreeBSD on a ThinkPad T40 ca. 2004.
2018-10-18 15:04:00	%koenig	Worked fine for me.
2018-10-18 15:07:41	%ahriman	billinja i just checked the chat history, my aunt still to this day works on AS/400s as a developer
2018-10-18 15:07:49	%ahriman	or that series, rather
2018-10-18 15:10:52	%koenig	Do you know what language she develops in?
2018-10-18 15:11:23	%koenig	AS/400 shops were big RPG/400 shops, but I don't know what else.
2018-10-18 15:15:15	⚡	dzho logs in to iceland, whispers "I'm in"
2018-10-18 15:16:49	@demure	welp... we may need to pester Membership about upgrading the ircd soon too. the "Too many connections from..." messages are happening more and more often. (some from normal users, so I expect it isn't necessarily caused by an attack) 
2018-10-18 15:17:03	%ahriman	she uses RPG
2018-10-18 15:20:34	%koenig	Yeah, RPG folks can crank out reports so fast.

2018-10-18 15:21:23	%ahriman	I bet. it always intrigued me, i want to play around with the os from those machines but don't have access to it
2018-10-18 15:29:25	%koenig	It's interesting in what it is, but realistically there are probably faster more modern solutions.
2018-10-18 15:29:51	%koenig	For example, most analytics cases these days want to be able to display interactive dashboards.
2018-10-18 15:30:13	%koenig	So you can use things like Tableau to quickly build those visualizations that reach into databases and Excel spreadsheets and JSON files and whatnot.
2018-10-18 15:30:55	%koenig	I always think of RPG, because of its heritage, as being geared toward generating paper reports that printed out on green and white bar paper.
2018-10-18 15:31:30	%koenig	ca. 1988-1992 when I was a computer operator, I used to run band printers to print out boxes and boxes of that paper.  Then I'd help deliver it throughout the hospital.
2018-10-18 15:31:44	%koenig	Now you'd have a computer display the results instead.
2018-10-18 15:33:32	@billinja	koenig: I'll likely give it a try on my T420s.  I'll post the results when I get around to it :)
2018-10-18 15:34:43	%koenig	Neat!  Thanks!  I'll be interested in hearing your experiences.
2018-10-18 15:34:58	@billinja	I had a small P10 AS/400 at home for a short time.  It was going to scrap, so I claimed it.  It was a CISC system, and the OS was so old you could barely do much with it.  I used it to teach myself CL programming to automate some administrative functions (spooled file cleanup, user enrollment etc..)
2018-10-18 16:01:57	%ahriman	koenig interesting enough my aunt graduated college with a CS degree in 1988 and thats when she began working with AS/400s and RPG
2018-10-18 16:05:39	%koenig	That'd be the right timeframe.  Holy cow you could clean house with that background.
2018-10-18 16:05:57	%koenig	AS/400 was sort of the descendent of the System 36 and System 38 lines.
2018-10-18 16:11:46	%ahriman	has anyone here tried one of the Talos II workstations running on an IBM POWER9? I kind of want to save up for the developer workstation out of a deep curiosity for other architectures
2018-10-18 16:11:57	@tidux	billinja: Thinkpad T and X generally work well
2018-10-18 16:18:18	@tidux	I'm going to be running Haiku on my X220 once I back up the current install's /home

2018-10-18 16:39:51	%koenig	Haven't talked to you for a while.
2018-10-18 16:40:02	@odie	hey ahriman, koenig!
2018-10-18 16:40:22	@odie	thats true :( had a lot going on in the last days
2018-10-18 16:40:35	@odie	the new job is pretty cool so far
2018-10-18 16:40:59	@odie	still in orientation phase

2018-10-18 16:44:25	%ahriman	gotta go to work, see y'all later
2018-10-18 16:44:42	%koenig	ha - my girlfriend moved in with an indoor rower that we have no room to set up!
2018-10-18 16:44:47	@odie	bye ahriman 
2018-10-18 16:45:09	@odie	too bad
2018-10-18 16:45:10	%koenig	Life is good with her.  I think she is surprised.  She is very independent and I think she thought she'd feel constrained by living with me.
2018-10-18 16:45:21	%koenig	But I think she is adjusting well.
2018-10-18 16:46:28	@odie	thats great to hear!
2018-10-18 16:48:41	@odie	and how is the situation at work?
2018-10-18 16:50:03	%koenig	Pretty good.  I'm engaged on a project until January and I also seem to have managed to get my "skunkworks" project funded by a client.
2018-10-18 16:50:10	%koenig	So that's pretty good I'd say.
2018-10-18 16:50:15	%koenig	I'm happy, at least.
2018-10-18 16:50:39	@odie	cool
2018-10-18 16:50:50	@odie	so life's good at the moment :)
2018-10-18 16:51:03	%koenig	Indeed so.
2018-10-18 16:54:08	@odie	uh, i think it's time to go to bed. don't want to imitate my son who fell asleep during dinner today ;)
2018-10-18 16:56:02	@odie	Good nicht!

2018-10-19 04:18:36	njsg	And logging in renews the tickets, so now I'm confused, I suppose I actually have to leave this running for 12 hours to expire the tickets.
2018-10-19 04:19:19	njsg	It makes sense it works this way, it's just that I had the idea it was easier to get to a situation where tickets had expired.

2018-10-19 05:19:40	njsg	I use irssi but I'm not going to say it's that great ever since they intentionally made it incompatible with software flow control.
2018-10-19 05:19:59	njsg	it works now because I'm using it remotely, so a local screen is doing the flow control
2018-10-19 05:20:03	@chals	njsg: come to the weechat then
2018-10-19 05:20:08	njsg	but that kind of makes it less usable if I were using it locally
2018-10-19 05:20:33	njsg	chals: I guess a must-ask question then is: does weechat allow software flow control to work flawlessly?
2018-10-19 05:20:57	@fmoonII	I'm still using a realy old irssi for my other irc uses, so I can't speak to its quality since then
2018-10-19 05:23:50	@chals	njsg: I am not 100% sure of that, but I would like to think so

2018-10-19 05:25:43	njsg	Well, if it does, when you hit control+S (and that gets passed directly to weechat, not to something in the middle) the screen shouldn't get updated, not even if you type anything, control+Q will then "unfreeze" the screen and whatever you typed should appear.
2018-10-19 05:26:34	njsg	chals: perhaps there is a file with the same name as the file/directory/... that would be created?
2018-10-19 05:28:21	@chals	njsg: I am trying a different network now, see what happens
2018-10-19 05:31:15	@mlaine	chals: thanks, i almost forgot it's FRIDAY
2018-10-19 05:31:24	@mlaine	YAY chals

2018-10-19 05:33:52	@chals	yay njsg 
2018-10-19 05:35:30	@chals	njsg: so now I am connected as chals-ii on #helpdesk
2018-10-19 05:36:43	njsg	I remember many months ago wondering why there were two slightly different highligh formats in my irssi theme
2018-10-19 05:36:46	@chals	on the down side I am not really sure how it works yet
2018-10-19 05:36:55	njsg	Only today did I realize in-text highlight is reverse video
2018-10-19 05:37:16	njsg	nick at the beginning of the string highlight is reverse video with the name of the highlighter in bold reverse video
2018-10-19 05:37:51	njsg	I should really try to fix the terminal emulator settings, it's becoming more and more obvious the terminal does a better job at handling bold...
2018-10-19 05:38:22	njsg	the difference is probably that xterm tries to use "bold" while the terminal changes the color intensity

2018-10-19 05:39:50	njsg	spk: hi
2018-10-19 05:39:51	@mlaine	good day spk
2018-10-19 05:40:08	@chals	so now I am here as chals-ii as well, still need to know how to speak a word
2018-10-19 05:40:19	njsg	write to file, I'd guess
2018-10-19 05:40:30	njsg	echo "test" >> file-representing-the-channel
2018-10-19 05:40:34	@spk	chals: you cloned yourself?
2018-10-19 05:40:48	njsg	no, he made a plan9-like version of himself
2018-10-19 05:40:58	@fmoonII	;)
2018-10-19 05:41:03	njsg	(I think plan9 does something like this for network protocols?)
2018-10-19 05:41:18	njsg	(At least for gopher that would be a great way to browse it)
2018-10-19 05:41:24	@mlaine	how's you spk?
2018-10-19 05:41:42	chals-ii	hi guys
2018-10-19 05:41:55	@mlaine	yay chals-ii :)
2018-10-19 05:42:01	@chals	oh man this is way way too nerdy
2018-10-19 05:42:13	njsg	chals-ii: so how did you do it?
2018-10-19 05:42:23	@mlaine	there's no such thing as way too nerdy :P
2018-10-19 05:42:39	njsg	there is "way too nedry", though
2018-10-19 05:42:57	@chals	njsg: in order to talk to any channel you have to cd #channel and echo "whatever you want to say" > in
2018-10-19 05:42:59	njsg	don't try to steal embryos and getting away with it during a storm
2018-10-19 05:43:11	@chals	;)
2018-10-19 05:43:14	njsg	chals: ah, so it has several files for each channel?
2018-10-19 05:44:13	@chals	njsg: yes there is an "in" and an "out" for every channel, in order to read what other say you have to cat the out file, 
2018-10-19 05:44:21	@chals	it is cool but not very handy
2018-10-19 05:44:30	@chals	really nerdy
2018-10-19 05:44:31	@fmoonII	tail -F out
2018-10-19 05:44:39	njsg	does out only have unread messages, or does it keep all messages?
2018-10-19 05:44:43	@chals	yay tail even
2018-10-19 05:44:54	njsg	one could imagine having a "history" or "backlog" file
2018-10-19 05:46:27	@fmoonII	with this you can basically create your own irc lcient interface with screen or tmux
2018-10-19 05:47:35	@fmoonII	it makes a lot of sense, reusing tmux functionality, not having to reimplement windows in the irc lcient itself
2018-10-19 05:47:51	@fmoonII	I'm pretty consistent in my typos

2018-10-19 05:52:37	@fmoonII	thanks for showing it off, I might look at it in the future
2018-10-19 05:52:47	njsg	Now if I had a quick and easy way to run an image viewer directly from screen...
2018-10-19 05:53:03	@chals	fmoonII: it is worth trying it is a different way of doing things
2018-10-19 05:53:49	njsg	(no big deal, I can copy the URL through the terminal emulator. Not being able to do it so quickly from here is probably a feature !)
2018-10-19 05:53:53	@chals	njsg: I used to like vp (view picture) long ago, I do not know if it even exists
2018-10-19 05:53:57	njsg	Is there a direct link, though?
2018-10-19 05:54:28	@fmoonII	'feh' was able to open it. 
2018-10-19 05:54:51	njsg	chals: the problem is that I have to copy the URL using the keyboard (unless screen can have a feature to scrap URLs from the window content ) and then paste it and do something with it
2018-10-19 05:54:57	njsg	doable, just a bit more complex
2018-10-19 05:55:02	@chals	njsg: that *is* the direct link http://i65.tinypic.com/2m5gt2t.png
2018-10-19 05:55:14	njsg	strange, in Seamonkey I get a tinypic site :-|
2018-10-19 05:55:20	@chals	oh I see
2018-10-19 05:56:00	njsg	it must be doing that User-agent based detection of webapp platforms (or worse, checking the accepted content types)
2018-10-19 05:56:26	njsg	pretty much, wget gets image/png
2018-10-19 05:56:31	njsg	Seamonkey gets text/html
2018-10-19 05:56:41	@fmoonII	:S
2018-10-19 05:56:47	njsg	wouldn't be so frustrating if the text/html *did* show the image
2018-10-19 05:56:52	njsg	agh, webdesigners these days
2018-10-19 05:57:31	njsg	chals: I didn't even need to read the window title of the terminal emulator to wonder "is that midnight commander" :-D
2018-10-19 05:58:48	njsg	it seems the page has the picture, but it is hidden using CSS™ 3®
2018-10-19 05:58:56	njsg	or any other version of CSS, who knows
2018-10-19 06:07:09	@chals	njsg: Yeah,  I am a huge fan ot the good old mc

2018-10-19 09:24:18	%koenig	Guys, I'm going to be winning $1B in the Mega Millions lottery tonight, so when I do I'm going to buy SDF and bump everybody up to SuperMetaARPA.
2018-10-19 09:24:28	%koenig	And next Friday I'm buying pizza for everybody.
2018-10-19 09:25:21	tomasino	that's sweet of you, koenig 
2018-10-19 09:26:29	tomasino	supermetaarpa sounds so fun. plan 9 vms all around?
2018-10-19 09:27:04	%koenig	Indeed.  Once I own SDF we'll be switching to Plan 9.
2018-10-19 09:27:47	%koenig	That way everybody can mount the filesystems and we can reimplement COM in terms of read/write IO operations.
2018-10-19 09:28:36	@fmoonII	that raises an interesting question. I really wonder if sdf leaders would sell out
2018-10-19 09:28:59	@fmoonII	in any case, happy friday koenig

2018-10-19 10:55:36	%koenig	I don't, although I keep threatening to.  I talk to one Slack group via the Web interface and I'm less engaged because it is not in my WeeChat.
2018-10-19 10:55:52	%koenig	I used to use the Slack IRC gateway.
2018-10-19 10:55:54	@elw	I'm trying to get it set back up and it seems they changed how they integrate
2018-10-19 10:56:12	@elw	You have to set it up as an authorized app, before I thought you could just setup an API token and do it that way
2018-10-19 10:56:26	@elw	Now, unfortunately, I'm not authorized to set it up where as before I was.
2018-10-19 10:56:33	@elw	because of my slack org perms
2018-10-19 10:56:36	@elw	:sigh:
2018-10-19 10:56:44	%koenig	That may be true.  I seem to recall that the Slack interface told me that the API token method would be deprecated soon.
2018-10-19 10:57:28	%koenig	Partly this is why I haven't invested a lot of time yet.  I don't like to invest my valuable time into things that external entities can arbitrarily change underneath me because then I end up wasting my time.

2018-10-19 14:06:51	njsg	koenig: that's pretty much why I stopped even trying to connect and caring with proprietary or commercial IM systems.
2018-10-19 14:07:06	njsg	It's a game where the only winning move is not to play
2018-10-19 14:07:10	njsg	Or
2018-10-19 14:07:32	njsg	it's a game where the only winning move is not to play the proprietary IM protocol game and instead sit and watch WarGames.
2018-10-19 14:08:38	@demure	speaking of IM protocols, I'm playing with tox chat right now
2018-10-19 14:08:42	@demure	it seems promissing
2018-10-19 14:09:30	%koenig	Is that the one from the 4Chan crew?
2018-10-19 14:09:59	@demure	O_o
2018-10-19 14:10:01	@demure	https://tox.chat
2018-10-19 14:10:31	%koenig	Ok, yes, it is.
2018-10-19 14:10:37	%koenig	So here's the story behind this software.
2018-10-19 14:10:50	%koenig	This software sprang out of discussions on 4Chan about 5 years ago.
2018-10-19 14:11:07	%koenig	All-in-all, nobody cares where it started of course as long as it is good software.
2018-10-19 14:11:18	@demure	*nod*
2018-10-19 14:11:45	%koenig	There was this thing called the Tox Foundation and a few years ago there were donations made to that foundation and then ToX development split up.
2018-10-19 14:12:04	%koenig	And it turned out that was because there was some disagreement about "misuse of funds".
2018-10-19 14:12:19	%koenig	And that split kind of weakened the momentum of the software.
2018-10-19 14:12:26	@demure	*nod*
2018-10-19 14:12:38	%koenig	It looks neat, but I haven't paid much attention for a couple years.  If it's back on track, that's good.
2018-10-19 14:13:06	@demure	I'm looking at it as a fix for my work flow with one frined
2018-10-19 14:13:30	@demure	currently we talk via signal, but that forces me to whip out my phone
2018-10-19 14:13:45	@demure	so I'm looking for a secure chat that can let me use my computer, and them their phone
2018-10-19 14:14:13	@demure	right now I'm leaning towards a tox group chat with a 'user' per device
2018-10-19 14:14:30	@demure	(I'm assuming concurrent logins aren't a thing)
2018-10-19 14:14:43	njsg	jabber/xmpp with pgp/gpg encryption?
2018-10-19 14:15:03	njsg	(with the bonus concurrent logins are definitely supported by the protocol)
2018-10-19 14:15:26	%koenig	Is Telegram an option?
2018-10-19 14:15:43	%koenig	I could potentially be talking out of my butt about Telegram.
2018-10-19 14:15:43	njsg	isn't telegram webapp only, or is there a stable protocol?
2018-10-19 14:15:52	njsg	er
2018-10-19 14:15:52	@demure	jabber may be an option, but security is a 'bolt-on'. It may be hard to find an ecryption that works for both clients
2018-10-19 14:15:55	njsg	a stable, *open* protocol
2018-10-19 14:16:00	%koenig	I thought there was a protocol for Telegram.
2018-10-19 14:16:56	njsg	demure: it definitely isn't guaranteed to be supported everywhere, but people who care about encryption might be ready for it. Now if it is for "encrypt everything end-to-end as part of a protocol", then jabber definitely isn't a choice
2018-10-19 14:17:07	njsg	there is always a protocol. Anything talking has to have a protocol
2018-10-19 14:17:15	njsg	the question is whether it is open and stable
2018-10-19 14:19:33	@fmoonII	read this comment about tox recently https://lobste.rs/s/6hpsqa/messenger_systems_compared_by_security#c_ftu8vt

2018-10-23 14:50:48	%koenig	Thanks.  I'm motivated but it's so easy to lose that motivation because this place is ultra competitive.
2018-10-23 14:51:08	%koenig	However that's how you grow: put yourself in an ultra competitive environment and then figure out how to win.

2018-10-24 12:54:13	⚡	njsg wonders if there is a nice way to convert git to RCS
2018-10-24 12:55:00	njsg	For some reason I at some point decided I wanted to version control some scripts with git. Then I gave up and started using RCS. Now I have RCS and git in the same directory, which is slightly confusing.
2018-10-24 12:56:16	njsg	Google search is being quite useless
2018-10-24 12:56:30	njsg	Because of course "git to RCS" returns results for "RCS to git"
2018-10-24 12:57:06	%koenig	You're going to wrong way, man!

2018-10-24 13:13:32	peteyboy	why?
2018-10-24 13:14:57	peteyboy	i mean, if you want to go back in time and not deal with hard to understand git, don't travel farther back than svn!
2018-10-24 13:17:30	njsg	What other revision control systems are there that can work on files, not directories? sccs?
2018-10-24 13:17:55	njsg	The question should also be why would I want to use git for this
2018-10-24 13:18:18	njsg	If the state of the art is so bad that there arens not even
2018-10-24 13:18:46	njsg	er aren't even tools to migrate from git to others, and options are git, git and git, I might go with plain files...
2018-10-24 13:20:44	njsg	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software#Local_data_model <-- fun that the only ones listed here *are* RCS and SCCS.
2018-10-24 13:34:56	peteyboy	because everyone uses git, and using git is way more interesting practice for you than RCS
2018-10-24 13:35:05	peteyboy	unless you already rule at git or something
2018-10-24 13:35:20	peteyboy	sure it's mind bending
2018-10-24 13:35:27	peteyboy	but even MS uses git now
2018-10-24 13:44:58	njsg	From that point of view, I should be using Microsoft Windows.
2018-10-24 13:45:22	njsg	And I should be using Eclipse and Visual Studio and Microsoft Word.
2018-10-24 13:46:20	njsg	Well, forget I asked...
2018-10-24 13:46:45	%koenig	You're not wrong for asking.
2018-10-24 13:47:20	%koenig	It's just that a lot of people find value in Git and will find it challenging to find advantages in something like RCS.
2018-10-24 13:47:48	%koenig	If RCS is exactly what you want, then you should absolutely use it.  You're not likely to find the tool you want though.
2018-10-24 13:48:15	njsg	It's just that, when the reaction is "just use whatever the majority uses", it's when stop having any hope.
2018-10-24 13:48:26	%koenig	But that's exactly the reason I run FreeBSD at home despite the fact that tons of people tell me I'm flying a fish as a flag.
2018-10-24 13:49:04	njsg	While I appreciate the joking comments here about "moving backwards", that's one thing, now that the answer is an attempt to convince me to use git instead
2018-10-24 13:49:09	%koenig	Well, there does become a point where there's so much friction to go against what's popular that you have to factor that into your assessment.
2018-10-24 13:49:24	njsg	Well, that's like the people who tell me to just use utf8 when I am trying to make ends meet with a non-utf8 terminal...
2018-10-24 13:49:57	njsg	koenig: and that friction is what is making me consider moving away from linux in the long run. Precisely for this kind of stuff.
2018-10-24 13:50:13	njsg	Although if you avoid certain internet places, you won't get as much bullying for not using systemd-networkmanager
2018-10-24 13:50:24	%koenig	It's hard for me to argue against you.  I'm sitting here today feeling like I swim upstream more than I should myself.

2018-10-24 13:52:15	njsg	As rightly pointed by Bill Watterson. But some days it looks like it's simply impossible.
2018-10-24 13:52:29	⚡	koenig nods.

2018-10-24 13:52:39	%koenig	This too shall pass.
2018-10-24 13:53:44	njsg	I might ask in USENET. In certain groups, it's more likely that people who know something might talk, and it shouldn't be like ycombinator, where they'll even demand you reimplement git in rust.
2018-10-24 13:54:08	%koenig	heh.
2018-10-24 13:54:35	%koenig	There is certainly a rather uniform mindset on HN.
2018-10-24 13:54:35	njsg	Either way, most annoyances there are promptly handled by killfiling Message-ID: .*googlegroups\.com.*
2018-10-24 13:54:55	njsg	it's voting-based, I think any such medium will converge towards a uniform mindset
2018-10-24 13:55:11	%koenig	Very likely true.
2018-10-24 13:55:16	njsg	unlike "social media", which are similar, but have distributed mindsets, everyone sees their own mindset
2018-10-24 13:55:36	%koenig	Well, that's why I am more on-board with the Mastodon model.
2018-10-24 13:56:00	%koenig	But hell, people are kicking that in the shins specifically because it's distributed.
2018-10-24 13:58:07	@fmoonII	do you have a fediverse account, koenig?
2018-10-24 13:59:07	njsg	You know what, this git-to-RCS thing is making me think of something...
2018-10-24 13:59:32	njsg	It used to be that more people would fight against closed or vendor-locked formats, and fight for interoperability
2018-10-24 14:00:09	njsg	Is the state of affairs so sad that we now get from git repositories what we used to get from Microsoft Office files? at least the details of git should be in the open... That *is* different
2018-10-24 14:00:37	njsg	But it looks like there's not much interest in allowing diversity
2018-10-24 14:01:49	%koenig	fmoonII: I do not.  But I already promised our friend adamd that he'd be my first connection when I set one up.  He "encourages" me semi-regularly.  :)
2018-10-24 14:07:04	njsg	I suppose the best approach so far would be to grab http://www.catb.org/~esr/cvs-fast-export/ and make it work the other way.
2018-10-24 14:25:32	peteyboy	Hey njsg, I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to dog you out for doing your own thing
2018-10-24 14:25:48	peteyboy	it's just that nothing interesting is happening in those old spaces.
2018-10-24 14:26:05	peteyboy	i have the same urge to use older dependable stuff sometimes
2018-10-24 14:26:56	peteyboy	using RCS is like using the CBM basic interpreter on sdf, I suppose, though I would find it way less interesting
2018-10-24 14:28:23	peteyboy	(to use RCS vs basic, what is RCS giving you in terms of delight, I guess I mean)
2018-10-24 14:28:41	peteyboy	i use git at work, and it still confuses me
2018-10-24 14:29:12	peteyboy	but the design of git is really interesting. It takes the whole version control thing to the next level
2018-10-24 14:29:31	peteyboy	it's like Seinfeld was to sitcoms before it, git is to VCS before it
2018-10-24 14:30:25	peteyboy	and also, you have to love the fact that git throws away the command-and-control model that a centralized version control system has

2018-10-24 16:52:04	njsg	git is quite good for concurrent coding, I like how it does not rely on a remote repository, but instead follows a truly distributed model. That's also handy for offline work.
2018-10-24 16:52:20	njsg	Now granularity and economy might be things it's not so good at
2018-10-24 16:52:51	njsg	While git has growing blobs with cryptic names, RCS has a filename,v file for each filename
2018-10-24 16:53:09	njsg	I might use an RCS directory, but even with that, it's RCS/filename,v
2018-10-24 16:53:23	njsg	Which is also easier to understand when there's rsync involved

2018-10-24 17:05:04	@fmoonII	read rcsintro(1) earlier. Seems good for a single person usage. Also, iirc, sdf uses rcs for its tutorials as it also makes sense on a multi-user environment like sdf and it seems to be easy enough to learn.
2018-10-24 17:24:47	%koenig	I actually forget how SVN tracks changes.  Isn't it on some per-file basis?

2018-10-24 17:31:23	mhj	Heyo all, since we're on the subject of version control, I heard some writers(Who don't always code) use version control for their stories. Is RCS the "simplest" of version control programs or is it better just to DIY if it just involves regular writing?

2018-10-24 17:35:33	njsg	I've used RCS for non-code writing
2018-10-24 17:35:34	@fmoonII	try 'man rcsintro' on sdf or read it here http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rcsintro++NetBSD-8.0 - Seems fairly simple to me :)
2018-10-24 17:36:42	mhj	Thanks njsg and fmoonII!
2018-10-24 17:36:49	njsg	Usually there's no restriction that prevents you from using version control for text documents
2018-10-24 17:37:21	njsg	in fact, I think you should try to do that if you're writing anything that's not simple, I mean, don't use it for your USENET posts, but do use it for academic works, reports, ...
2018-10-24 17:37:58	njsg	I'd say the biggest hurdle is how some formats are designed, especially now that it seems that zipped XML is so popular
2018-10-24 17:38:27	mhj	zipped XML sounds like a nightmare
2018-10-24 17:38:51	njsg	So you wouldn't be able to use RCS/git/... so well with word or openoffice documents. If you do use OpenOffice or LibreOffice, at least some formats have a "Flat" variant, which is a longer non-compressed XML File
2018-10-24 17:39:14	njsg	It will still be a bit harder to read, but much better for version control.
2018-10-24 17:39:27	njsg	But I usually write in plain text or LaTeX, so I don't have that problem
2018-10-24 17:40:02	mhj	I plan to write it using just regular Unix stuff. I'm on OpenBSD.
2018-10-24 17:40:15	njsg	if you use LaTeX, there's also latexdiff (you might need to use a hammer to get everything right, but it's still useful)
2018-10-24 17:40:46	mhj	Only after I've written everything will I make it look pretty with LibreOffice
2018-10-24 17:40:52	@fmoonII	well, you're in luck, rcs is in base, as it is the foundation of cvs, iirc
2018-10-24 17:42:09	mhj	Yeah I was just reading the man pages for RCS 
2018-10-24 17:46:56	njsg	Someone in a comment on a blog post by jwz mentions something which might be a bug in some implementation of RCS. https://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/03/i-am-literally-the-last-person-in-the-world-to-ever-try-and-convert-from-cvs-to-git/#comment-147270 But I do enjoy RCS so much that, if such a problem exists in the implementation I use, I know what my choice will be: to fix it.
2018-10-24 17:47:15	njsg	But I'd be surprised if it hadn't been fixed yet, as it is used by CVS...

2018-10-25 15:05:04	njsg	This is going to be a silly simple question, but google is being as useful as I expected... are there actually any terminals (not emulators) which support utf8?
2018-10-25 15:11:37	%koenig	Without trying to Google for it, my initial guess would be "no".
2018-10-25 15:12:07	%koenig	UTF-8 got popular after the timeframe when a lot of people used dumb terminals.
2018-10-25 15:13:06	%koenig	I guess that maybe the most recent dumb terminals might support it if there were recent firmware, or something like a modern X11 terminal might.
2018-10-25 15:13:23	njsg	I'm inclined to think the same way. I also suppose if some terminal has the capabilities for that and an owner with time and interest to do some hacking, there might be ways to "upgrade" the terminal. But stars and planets would have to be aligned the right way for that to happen.
2018-10-25 15:13:29	%koenig	But even the heyday of X11 terminals was before I ever heard of UTF-8.
2018-10-25 15:15:02	%koenig	According to Wikipedia, UTF-8 was first officially presented at USENIX in January 1993.
2018-10-25 15:15:34	%koenig	I had a dumb terminal on my desk and also an X11 terminal on my desk ca. that time.
2018-10-25 15:16:04	%koenig	Probably the last time I touched a dumb terminal would have been sometime around 1996 or 1998 but I was certainly mostly on PCs by that timeframe.
2018-10-25 15:16:18	%koenig	I'm gonna guess the answer to your question is "no".

2018-10-25 16:54:07	zcrayfish	yes, yes, update Windows XP..................... "2018-10 Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 8 for WES09 and POSReady 2009 for x86-based systems (KB4462949)"
2018-10-25 16:54:19	⚡	zcrayfish points IE8 to pornhub and hopes for the best
2018-10-25 16:55:44	njsg	Honestly, I think the value of updating everything quickly is way overrated nowadays.
2018-10-25 16:56:13	zcrayfish	I update haphazardly
2018-10-25 16:56:53	njsg	Of course it will depend on what you use the computer for, but it shouldn't be that hard to be safe using an older system.
2018-10-25 16:57:25	zcrayfish	It's actually amazingly easy on IE8: Turn off SSL support completely and the older versions of TLS that it supports....
2018-10-25 16:57:29	zcrayfish	then you will be locked out of most sites.
2018-10-25 16:57:34	njsg	Instead of being objective, some people will just invoke dark magic and say "here be dragons" if you don't update. Which is ironical because the unchartered waters are usually the updates themselves.
2018-10-25 16:57:46	njsg	zcrayfish: Oh, I've seen that and I don't even use IE.
2018-10-25 16:58:02	zcrayfish	I only use IE for entertainment........ like...
2018-10-25 16:58:06	njsg	Last time I tried to browse the web in my Windows 98 machine, I couldn't do much
2018-10-25 16:58:14	zcrayfish	"Oh, that HTML 2.0 element is /STILL/ not supported?"
2018-10-25 16:58:45	zcrayfish	the lack of TLS support is the biggest thing...
2018-10-25 16:59:02	zcrayfish	just a few years ago you'd run into lack of HOST header with older browsers (anything 4.0 and down basically)
2018-10-25 16:59:19	zcrayfish	Opera 3.62 works pretty well on Windows 3.1............... no joke.
2018-10-25 17:00:44	zcrayfish	pardon the nonsense, I thought I was on freenode. xD xD

2018-10-26 09:27:13	njsg	I might want to get a new USB pendrive, now I was checking, some of the cheaper ones in a store are USB 3.0 or even 3.1
2018-10-26 09:28:11	njsg	It's clear from several places that using those with USB 2.0 is not a problem... now I suppose this thing is indeed designed to be backwards-compatible, but they fail to say whether it also works with USB 1 or not
2018-10-26 09:32:11	@rcf	njsg: anything that works with 2.0 will work with 1 as well. Just very, very slowly, obviously. 
2018-10-26 09:34:23	@rcf	njsg: 2.0 devices always start out in full speed mode, then try to negotiate high speed if available. 
2018-10-26 09:36:10	%koenig	Happy FRIDAY #sdf.
2018-10-26 09:44:32	njsg	rcf: the only concrete thing I found so far is about the available current, which is probably not an issue for pendrives, and I don't expect the maximum current of the standard to be exactly the maximum current the USB host can provide
2018-10-26 09:44:43	njsg	So yeah, I guess it will work
2018-10-26 09:44:53	njsg	But I'll leave this for another day as I'm already late for the train
2018-10-26 09:45:38	@rcf	njsg: USB 2.0 has the same 500mA limit as 1.0, so it will be fine. 
2018-10-26 09:46:41	@rcf	If it can't provide that, even 1.0 pendrives are not guaranteed to work. 
2018-10-26 09:46:51	@rcf	So you might as well go for it.

2018-10-26 11:37:45	@demure	I believe vm drivers have gotten better since then
2018-10-26 11:38:54	@demure	oh, and a bit of snafu in the past with serial to usb cables w/ 2.0 vs 3.0 ports

2018-10-30 10:00:15	%koenig	I'm not so much ready to think about snow.
2018-10-30 10:00:30	@benharri	uuuf no thanks 
2018-10-30 10:00:31	njsg	One of the two times I went to Jyväskylä, it was quite snowy (must have been January/February?). The train ride was amazing.
2018-10-30 10:00:40	@benharri	not ready for snow at all
2018-10-30 10:00:55	@benharri	though i do have a snowblower this year, so it will be somewhat easier to deal with
2018-10-30 10:01:13	njsg	Snow is a nice sight. Poetic, in a way. It's weak winters I have a problem with.
2018-10-30 10:01:20	%koenig	Fortunately I do not have to remove snow.  And I live in an area that gets little snow.
2018-10-30 10:01:46	@benharri	what do you mean by weak winters?
2018-10-30 10:01:47	njsg	weak winters, the ones with little snow and with slippery surfaces and rain and ice
2018-10-30 10:01:52	@benharri	ah
2018-10-30 10:02:03	%koenig	Over the holidays I will likely be in Indiana visiting family.  It snowed a lot last holidays in Indiana and that was nice.  And it was nice to drive south away from it and leave it behind.
2018-10-30 10:02:14	@benharri	i think i'm just not cut out for winter. i should move.
2018-10-30 10:03:15	njsg	Right now here it's cold as heavens (well, I can't say "as hell", can I?). Some "cold front" or "polar front"

2018-10-30 10:04:26	njsg	(I mean it is quite colder than what is expected for this time of the year, with very cold air. It being windy doesn't help. Nor does the rain.)
2018-10-30 10:04:39	@benharri	cold is relative, after all
2018-10-30 10:05:25	njsg	With some sunny moments, but that only matters if you're well insulated, otherwise the cold air quickly outweights that.
2018-10-30 10:06:16	njsg	Cold/warmth sure is relative, and it feels like comparing the temperature values alone doesn't work
2018-10-30 10:07:39	@benharri	you can get a basic idea of how cold it might be, but it's definitely not the whole picture
2018-10-30 10:50:59	@odie	hey sdf :)
2018-10-30 10:54:25	%koenig	Hi odie!
2018-10-30 10:57:04	njsg	ohei
2018-10-30 10:59:21	@odie	hey hey
2018-10-30 10:59:26	@odie	how are you guys?
2018-10-30 11:01:23	%koenig	Pretty good, but busy with work.
2018-10-30 11:01:35	%koenig	Although right now I have the Apple keynote streaming in a window.
2018-10-30 11:02:53	@odie	did they finally invented the 2000€ cell phone?
2018-10-30 11:03:46	@demure	I'm pretty sure there have been more expensive phones -- involving gold and jewels 
2018-10-30 11:04:55	@odie	i mean the kidn of cell phone a 13 year old needs in order to be accepted at school
2018-10-30 11:05:04	@odie	with an apple on it
2018-10-30 11:06:47	njsg	And apparently HSL is changing ticketing, and they're apparently getting rid of one thing they did well: reduced fares for single tickets...
2018-10-30 11:07:01	@odie	i'm experimenting with threat intelligence feeds
2018-10-30 11:07:17	@odie	fetching and storing them into a database
2018-10-30 11:07:34	@odie	creating a feed from it that i can use 
2018-10-30 11:07:50	njsg	The change in the fare zones isn't new, I think this has been in the works for some years already, what I see is that Kirkkonummi is now four zones away from Helsinki (used to be 3)
2018-10-30 11:08:09	@odie	and with some ssh/telnet honeypots that deliver information for this database
2018-10-30 11:08:53	njsg	And travelling to/from HEL will involve more zones.
2018-10-30 11:15:14	@odie	about that iphone stuff i wrote: I now have an iphone se mysqlf (company phone) and it's pretty nice. but i can't understand why one would pay 1500 bucks for the bigger models
2018-10-30 11:15:31	njsg	peer pressure, status symbol, capitalism
2018-10-30 11:15:45	njsg	for short, one is convinced one has to pay 1500 bucks for such a thing
2018-10-30 11:16:43	njsg	It doesn't make sense until you realize a lot of people are easily deceived and manipulated by advertising.

2018-10-30 11:19:18	%koenig	I don't rush out and buy a new phone every year or even every two years.  Mostly I keep an iPhone for 4-5 years.
2018-10-30 11:20:01	%koenig	But paying to have a good device in my pocket that allows me to communicate on the go and to be hooked into my calendar/contacts/messages/etc. and to give me the ability to SEE what I'm doing on it is valuable to me.
2018-10-30 11:20:27	%koenig	I'm willing to buy an iPhone for a little higher price if it works to accomplish all those things.
2018-10-30 11:21:04	%koenig	I'm not heavily invested into the Google ecosystem, so Android is not as good of a fit for me.
2018-10-30 11:21:12	@rcf	I end up doing the same with the iPhone. I basically use it as a dumphone with a slightly better web browser. 
2018-10-30 11:21:48	@odie	but 1500$?
2018-10-30 11:21:54	@odie	this is sooo much money
2018-10-30 11:22:13	@rcf	Android was fun for a while but keeping it up to date against manufactuer and network wishes was just too annoying for my primary phone. 
2018-10-30 11:22:15	njsg	Android seems to be also poorly designed
2018-10-30 11:22:30	njsg	Whatever you do, if you must go with android, do yourself a favour and don't pick Samsung.
2018-10-30 11:24:50	%koenig	I look at the number of days it takes me to earn $1,500.  It's only a few days, and I carry the phone for 4 or 5 years.  It's worth it to me.
2018-10-30 11:25:12	@odie	hm, thats a way to look at it
2018-10-30 11:25:24	%koenig	If I were still a student and $1,500 were more like a month of pay, maybe it'd be different.  Although I suspect not.
2018-10-30 11:25:31	@odie	didn't mean to be an axxxole
2018-10-30 11:25:46	%koenig	I didn't take it as your being an asshole.
2018-10-30 11:25:55	%koenig	People have different perspectives, of course.
2018-10-30 11:25:56	@odie	but i really think that it's just too much money for a phone
2018-10-30 11:25:57	@odie	in general
2018-10-30 11:26:08	%koenig	Oh, I agree that they are expensive.
2018-10-30 11:26:22	@odie	have to admit that i enjoy the SE especially because of its screen size
2018-10-30 11:26:28	@odie	i had a large android before
2018-10-30 11:26:29	%koenig	And when you see that a $1,500 iPhone is more expensive than a whole computer, it seems obnoxious.
2018-10-30 11:26:37	@demure	njsg: I'd add sony to the list too, unless you don't care about being lied to about the ability to root 
2018-10-30 11:26:40	@odie	which is comfortable to use on the couch
2018-10-30 11:26:56	@odie	but is just too large for my trouse pocket
2018-10-30 11:27:04	@odie	*trouser
2018-10-30 11:28:05	%koenig	I carry a iPhone 6S which I think is 5.8".
2018-10-30 11:28:33	%koenig	Part of me wants a bigger iPhone, but I don't know if I want to carry it in my pocket.
2018-10-30 11:28:43	%koenig	If I were to pair it with an iPad Pro, that'd probably be a good combination.
2018-10-30 11:29:22	@demure	why are ****ing giant phones the trend :(
2018-10-30 11:29:41	%koenig	The cool part is you can pull the iPad Pro out, whip out its keyboard, and it'll use Bluetooth to pair with your iPhone to let you be online.
2018-10-30 11:30:01	%koenig	With Blink Shell for the iPad Pro, you can get mosh into your "real" computers.
2018-10-30 11:30:32	@odie	here's my wish for a 1500$ phone: it's small and powerful, my employer pays for it, i have a docking station at home and at work and it converts into a workstation when it's in the dock
2018-10-30 11:30:43	njsg	koenig: more than being worth it, I'd say that analysis says "it does no big harm"
2018-10-30 11:30:51	@odie	so i can use it with multiple screens and a keyboard
2018-10-30 11:31:06	njsg	A whole computer might soon become more expensive
2018-10-30 11:31:25	njsg	As they™ are slowly trying to push things towards tablet-and-smartphone-computing
2018-10-30 11:31:41	@odie	and it has a container solution on board that separates private from corporate data
2018-10-30 11:32:02	njsg	I think IBM PC-compatibles had that
2018-10-30 11:32:07	%koenig	njsg: I've seen that coming for a long time.  I already use my laptops as "dumb terminals" to get to my "real" computers.
2018-10-30 11:32:14	njsg	it was called removable hard drives; or even floppies :-P
2018-10-30 11:32:25	njsg	koenig: yeah, it has been in the works for several years now
2018-10-30 11:32:42	njsg	I don't know when did I first start getting worried about it, but it's no big news to me now
2018-10-30 11:33:01	%koenig	odie: If the trend toward less expensive devices kept up, it wouldn't matter if your phone could dock and be your desktop.  You'd just have an inexpensive desktop everywhere you went.
2018-10-30 11:33:07	njsg	All I can say is that we're extremely lucky that the personal computer happened and gave us cheap workstations
2018-10-30 11:33:31	%koenig	Of course the device makers like Apple want devices to stay expensive.
2018-10-30 11:33:54	%koenig	But it's more Google's model that your data lives in the cloud and your devices are inexpensive.  Chromebooks and Chromeboxes and whatever aren't expensive.
2018-10-30 11:34:03	njsg	And what I see now is that we're being pushed towards less tweakable and less flexible devices. No matter what the processing power is, if you can't get your hands inside it easily, or easily write some software for it...
2018-10-30 11:34:21	njsg	Now the internet connection, that might be not-inexpensive.
2018-10-30 11:45:16	%koenig	Devices now are throw-away gadgets.
2018-10-30 11:45:55	%koenig	In that sense, the Google approach is better in that you spend something like $300 for a Chromebook and use it for 3 +/- years and toss it.
2018-10-30 11:46:24	%koenig	Your data lives in the Cloud (or in the case of most SDF people, on your own server somewhere) and the device is irrelevant.
2018-10-30 11:49:05	njsg	I was just reading https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/its-repair-day-no-one-should-be-punished-contempt-business-model
2018-10-30 11:49:39	njsg	A bit US-specific, but the truth is that, all over the world, there are laws and corporate interests that will actively try to screw you if you ever dream of making it not-throw-away.
2018-10-30 11:50:34	%koenig	My main computer, and my data (which I care about the most), is a Xeon server in my apartment that has a VPN connection to my VPS running on Linode.
2018-10-30 11:50:54	%koenig	I can repair that server because it has a real case and motherboard.

2018-10-31 15:26:28	@seanh	I just signed up, and am planning to use my 800GB ma quota. It'll take a while for me to upload that much but it will take half of the remaining free disk space on ma

2018-10-31 16:13:21	@fmoonII	recently learned that lynx is able to put numbers next to links so you can navigate more quickly. much like vimperator and other graphical browsers/plugins can. Very neat :)
2018-10-31 16:19:42	njsg	I suppose that's where vimperator and pentadactyl got that idea
2018-10-31 16:19:58	njsg	elinks does that too (togglable as well, possibly disabled by default)
2018-10-31 16:20:32	njsg	I don't know about w3m, but I use it mostly as M-x emacs-w3m, and there I'm happy with the defaults
2018-10-31 16:20:40	njsg	(at least for now)
2018-10-31 16:21:32	njsg	There is one thing that I've been meaning to "solve" using one of those browsers, making them dump bold escape codes where appropriate

2018-11-01 11:17:41	@odie	hey koenig!
2018-11-01 11:17:45	@odie	how are you today?
2018-11-01 11:19:12	%koenig	I'm well, although pretty busy.  I was up most of the night last night getting ready for a demo for a partner on Friday morning US time.
2018-11-01 11:19:29	@odie	oh
2018-11-01 11:19:35	@odie	that sounds stressful
2018-11-01 11:19:52	%koenig	Then our colleagues in India reported that they would not be ready for the dry-run demo this morning and asked to delay it by 15 hours.  So that means I will be up all day and the demo will be midnight local time.
2018-11-01 11:20:10	@odie	what?
2018-11-01 11:20:11	@odie	really?
2018-11-01 11:20:17	%koenig	It's actually good for me that that happened because my parts are relatively ready to go, so I just get some additional time to work on them.
2018-11-01 11:20:41	@odie	i don't know what the dependencies/penalties are but i would cancel the demo
2018-11-01 11:21:04	@odie	ok, thats a way to look at it ;)
2018-11-01 11:21:09	%koenig	It's an "internal only" demo for the partner in charge of the project.  The real demo is November 29 for the client.
2018-11-01 11:21:34	%koenig	India has holidays this week and next week.
2018-11-01 11:21:44	%koenig	So everybody is busy and the schedule is hectic.
2018-11-01 11:21:54	%koenig	But, you know, part of me is happier being busy than idle.
2018-11-01 11:22:04	%koenig	Anyway, how are you doing??
2018-11-01 11:22:25	@odie	i am peachy
2018-11-01 11:22:46	@odie	my wife's out with the kid and i don't have to work because its a holiday where i live
2018-11-01 11:23:01	@odie	so i have happy time
2018-11-01 11:23:07	%koenig	Oh yeah, today is All Saints Day.
2018-11-01 11:23:21	amar	koenig: your colleagues from India are from Bangalore? :)
2018-11-01 11:23:41	%koenig	Uhh, I'd have to double check.
2018-11-01 11:23:43	@odie	it's not a holiday in all states here
2018-11-01 11:23:54	@odie	but luckily in my state :)
2018-11-01 11:24:16	%koenig	amar: Yes they are.
2018-11-01 11:24:24	amar	In Bangalore (Karnataka) it's a statewide holiday - its foundation day.
2018-11-01 11:25:09	amar	odie where are you from? 
2018-11-01 11:25:22	%koenig	Yes, that's one of the reasons why they are having problems getting the demo together.  One of the developers has no way to get to the office and is working from home, but they all need to work together and can't do it.
2018-11-01 11:25:46	@odie	amar: south-west germany
2018-11-01 11:25:51	amar	Ah, I see. I had the day off. 
2018-11-01 11:26:08	amar	odie nice. 
2018-11-01 11:27:09	@odie	it's wierd to say "south-west" since germany is a pretty small country but reagrding holidays it makes  a big difference ;)
2018-11-01 11:37:48	%koenig	Yeah, values change a lot from region to region in Germany.  Seems like the south is a lot more conservative and the north is a lot more liberal.
2018-11-01 11:38:17	@odie	yep
2018-11-01 11:38:38	@odie	too conservative

2018-11-01 20:36:38	%koenig	It has to do with "engagement".

2018-11-01 21:56:19	amar	How's it going? Your demo done?
2018-11-01 21:57:01	%koenig	No, not yet.  We're meeting with the team in India in 2 hours to go over their part.
2018-11-01 21:57:25	%koenig	They had technical difficulties and asked to delay their part.  It will be midnight here.
2018-11-01 21:57:46	%koenig	The real demo for the partner is in almost exactly 12 hours time.
2018-11-01 21:59:39	njsg	That does not sound healthy, unless there's sleep in between.

2018-11-05 08:54:56	njsg	So I needed to use bluetooth to pull some stuff from my cell phone
2018-11-05 08:55:21	njsg	As BlueZ is a bit messy, I thought "why not use the windows VM, it'll surely be simpler"
2018-11-05 08:56:08	njsg	Things I've learned today: either Windows Server 2008R2 does not support bluetooth, or the bluetooth stack is so poor it needs vendor-specific software to work.
2018-11-05 09:41:30	njsg	Went with a linux VM, although I had to figure how that BlueZ release does things. Turns out the messages aren't stored in chronological order, which might explain why the phone takes some time to show the messages...

2018-11-05 16:07:06	%koenig	I have TSA PreCheck, so I literally just put my stuff on the x-ray belt and walk through the metal detector.
2018-11-05 16:07:17	%koenig	It takes me approximately 30 seconds to go through security most times.
2018-11-05 16:07:32	%koenig	But that's because I travel all the time for work, so my company paid for TSA PreCheck.
2018-11-05 16:08:06	njsg	That sounds like the usual security check in some parts of europe.
2018-11-05 16:08:24	njsg	well, not the 30s part
2018-11-05 16:09:05	njsg	that'll depend on queues, and I guess skipping that is part of the precheck.

2018-11-07 13:02:20	+ahriman	ahh bashy took my hop status away. i was wondering how i got it in the first place
2018-11-07 13:05:19	%koenig	If you connect from one of the cluster nodes, it should hop you.
2018-11-07 13:05:28	%koenig	You're ARPA, so the bot should do it.
2018-11-07 13:05:38	+ahriman	ah okay
2018-11-07 13:06:57	+ahriman	have you messed with gentoo? i just finished an install and had so much fun with it

2018-11-07 13:11:34	%koenig	I have not done anything with Gentoo.  Mostly "back in the day" when it was super popular its main notion was that you compile everything from scratch.
2018-11-07 13:11:47	%koenig	So I didn't want to mess with that and wait.  Machines back then were slower, too.
2018-11-07 13:12:24	%koenig	Now there are enough distributions that I just run Ubuntu and am done with it.  I mostly just want to have my computer do work for me and don't mess much with the distro itself anymore.
2018-11-07 13:12:41	%koenig	But I'm glad you had a chance to install it and explore.  That's so much fun, eh?

2018-11-07 15:01:59	njsg	Agh, it seems a script of mine didn't correctly account for changes in the locale
2018-11-07 15:03:15	njsg	it generates a filename from TITLE (HTML), çáàã etc are correctly converted to caaa in a terminal emulator, but not in the terminal. Shouldn't be hard to fix, though.
2018-11-07 15:05:46	njsg	... actually, I'm using iconv with explicit encodings, so the problem should be elsewhere
2018-11-07 15:18:14	njsg	Ah, I forgot sed was also changing the text, and it assumes the locale encoding

2018-11-07 15:59:25	njsg	I'm curious about the outcomes of yesterday's USA midterm, anybody here who's following this knows of a good place to see some result tables (without AJAX)?
2018-11-07 16:00:01	njsg	Especially with everything else that was voted yesterday? (AFAIK in the US there's a bunch of things that might get voted together, including referenda?)
2018-11-07 16:02:42	jcrawford	you'll have a hard time finding one source that meets your criteria, I think. the total number of things voted yesterday will have been very, very large nationally, so national news sites generally only report on the big ticket items. most states probably publish full info online.
2018-11-07 16:03:05	jcrawford	e.g. my state has this rather reasonable webpage: http://electionresults.sos.state.nm.us/
2018-11-07 16:03:36	jcrawford	but if you start drilling into the county/municipal items... there's probably a few hundred different ballot items just in this state, depending on the jurisdiction.
